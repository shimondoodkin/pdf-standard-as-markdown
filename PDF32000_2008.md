# Foreword

On January 29, 2007, Adobe Systems Incorporated announced it's intention
to release the full Portable Document Format (PDF) 1.7 specification to
the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) and the Enterprise
Content Management Association (AIIM), for the purpose of publication by
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

PDF has become a de facto global standard for more secure and dependable
information exchange since Adobe published the complete PDF
specification in 1993. Both government and private industry have come to
rely on PDF for the volumes of electronic records that need to be more
securely and reliably shared, managed, and in some cases preserved for
generations. Since 1995 Adobe has participated in various working groups
that develop technical specifications for publication by ISO and worked
within the ISO process to deliver specialized subsets of PDF as
standards for specific industries and functions. Today, PDF for Archive
(PDF/A) and PDF for Exchange (PDF/X) are ISO standards, and PDF for
Engineering (PDF/E) and PDF for Universal Access (PDF/UA) are proposed
standards. Additionally, PDF for Healthcare (PDF/H) is an AIIM proposed
Best Practice Guide. AIIM serves as the administrator for PDF/A, PDF/E,
PDF/UA and PDF/H.

In the spring of 2008 the ISO 32000 document was prepared by Adobe
Systems Incorporated (based upon PDF Reference, sixth edition, Adobe
Portable Document Format version 1.7, November 2006) and was reviewed,
edited and adopted, under a special "fast-track procedure", by Technical
Committee ISO/TC 171, *Document management application*, Subcommittee SC
2, *Application issues*, in parallel with its approval by the ISO member
bodies.

[In January 2008, this ISO technical committee approved the final
revised documentation for PDF 1.7 as the](http://www.iso.org/)
[international standard ISO 32000-1. In July 2008 the ISO document was
placed for sale on the ISO web site](http://www.iso.org/)
[(](http://www.iso.org/)[http://www.iso.org]{.underline}).

This document you are now reading is a copy of the ISO 32000-1 standard.
By agreement with ISO, Adobe Systems is allowed to offer this version of
the ISO standard as a free PDF file on it's web site. It is not an
official ISO document but the technical content is identical including
the section numbering and page numbering.

# Introduction

ISO 32000 specifies a digital form for representing documents called the
Portable Document Format or usually referred to as PDF. PDF was
developed and specified by Adobe Systems Incorporated beginning in 1993
and continuing until 2007 when this ISO standard was prepared. The Adobe
Systems version PDF 1.7 is the basis for this ISO 32000 edition. The
specifications for PDF are backward inclusive, meaning that PDF 1.7
includes all of the functionality previously documented in the Adobe PDF
Specifications for versions 1.0 through 1.6. It should be noted that
where Adobe removed certain features of PDF from their standard, they
too are not contained herein.

The goal of PDF is to enable users to exchange and view electronic
documents easily and reliably, independent of the environment in which
they were created or the environment in which they are viewed or
printed. At the core of PDF is an advanced imaging model derived from
the PostScript® page description language. This PDF Imaging Model
enables the description of text and graphics in a device-independent and
resolution-independent manner. To improve performance for interactive
viewing, PDF defines a more structured format than that used by most
PostScript language programs. Unlike Postscript, which is a programming
language, PDF is based on a structured binary file format that is
optimized for high performance in interactive viewing. PDF also includes
objects, such as annotations and hypertext links, that are not part of
the page content itself but are useful for interactive viewing and
document interchange.

PDF files may be created natively in PDF form, converted from other
electronic formats or digitized from paper, microform, or other hard
copy format. Businesses, governments, libraries, archives and other
institutions and individuals around the world use PDF to represent
considerable bodies of important information.

Over the past fourteen years, aided by the explosive growth of the
Internet, PDF has become widely used for the electronic exchange of
documents. There are several specific applications of PDF that have
evolved where limiting the use of some features of PDF and requiring the
use of others, enhances the usefulness of PDF. ISO 32000 is an ISO
standard for the full function PDF; the following standards are for more
specialized uses. PDF/ X (ISO 15930) is now the industry standard for
the intermediate representation of printed material in electronic
prepress systems for conventional printing applications. PDF/A (ISO
19005) is now the industry standard for the archiving of digital
documents. PDF/E (ISO 24517) provides a mechanism for representing
engineering documents and exchange of engineering data. As major
corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions
streamline their operations by replacing paper-based workflow with
electronic exchange of information, the impact and opportunity for the
application of PDF will continue to grow at a rapid pace.

PDF, together with software for creating, viewing, printing and
processing PDF files in a variety of ways, fulfils a set of requirements
for electronic documents including:

- preservation of document fidelity independent of the device, platform,
  and software,

- merging of content from diverse sources---Web sites, word processing
  and spreadsheet programs, scanned documents, photos, and
  graphics---into one self-contained document while maintaining the
  integrity of all original source documents,

- collaborative editing of documents from multiple locations or
  platforms,

- digital signatures to certify authenticity,

- security and permissions to allow the creator to retain control of the
  document and associated rights,

- accessibility of content to those with disabilities,

- extraction and reuse of content for use with other file formats and
  applications, and

- electronic forms to gather data and integrate it with business
  systems.

The International Organization for Standardization draws attention to
the fact that it is claimed that compliance with this document may
involve the use of patents concerning the creation, modification,
display and processing of PDF files which are owned by the following
parties:

- Adobe Systems Incorporated, 345 Park Avenue, San Jose,
  California,95110-2704, USA

ISO takes no position concerning the evidence, validity and scope of
these patent rights.

The holders of these patent rights has assured the ISO that they are
willing to negotiate licenses under reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms and conditions with applicants throughout the world. In this
respect, the statements of the holders of these patent rights are
registered with ISO. Information may be obtained from those parties
listed above.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this
document may be the subject of patent rights other than those identified
above. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such
patent rights.

## 6 Version Designations

For the convenience of the reader, the PDF versions in which various
features were introduced are provided informatively within this
document. The first version of PDF was designated PDF 1.0 and was
specified by Adobe Systems Incorporated in the PDF Reference 1.0
document published by Adobe and Addison Wesley. Since then, PDF has gone
through seven revisions designated as: PDF 1.1, PDF 1.2, PDF 1.3, PDF
1.4, PDF 1.5, PDF 1.6 and PDF 1.7. All non-deprecated features defined
in a previous PDF version were also included in the subsequent PDF
version. Since ISO 32000-1 is a PDF version matching PDF 1.7, it is also
suitable for interpretation of files made to conform with any of the PDF
specifications 1.0 through 1.7. Throughout this specification in order
to indicate at which point in the sequence of versions a feature was
introduced, a notation with a PDF version number in parenthesis (e.g.,
*(PDF 1.3)*) is used. Thus if a feature is labelled with *(PDF 1.3)* it
means that PDF 1.0, PDF 1.1 and PDF 1.2 were not specified to support
this feature whereas all versions of PDF 1.3 and greater were defined to
support it.

##  7 Syntax

###  7.1 General

This clause covers everything about the syntax of PDF at the object,
file, and document level. It sets the stage for subsequent clauses,
which describe how the contents of a PDF file are interpreted as page
descriptions, interactive navigational aids, and application-level
logical structure.

PDF syntax is best understood by considering it as four parts, as shown
in Figure 1:

- *Objects*. A PDF document is a data structure composed from a small
  set of basic types of data objects. Sub-clause 7.2, \"Lexical
  Conventions,\" describes the character set used to write objects and
  other syntactic elements. Sub-clause 7.3, \"Objects,\" describes the
  syntax and essential properties of the objects. Sub-clause 7.3.8,
  \"Stream Objects,\" provides complete details of the most complex data
  type, the stream object.

- *File structure*. The PDF file structure determines how objects are
  stored in a PDF file, how they are accessed, and how they are updated.
  This structure is independent of the semantics of the objects.
  Subclause 7.5, \"File Structure,\" describes the file structure.
  Sub-clause 7.6, \"Encryption,\" describes a file-level mechanism for
  protecting a document's contents from unauthorized access.

- *Document structure*. The PDF document structure specifies how the
  basic object types are used to represent components of a PDF document:
  pages, fonts, annotations, and so forth. Sub-clause 7.7, \"Document
  Structure,\" describes the overall document structure; later clauses
  address the detailed semantics of the components.

- *Content streams*. A PDF *content stream* contains a sequence of
  instructions describing the appearance of a page or other graphical
  entity. These instructions, while also represented as objects, are
  conceptually distinct from the objects that represent the document
  structure and are described separately. Sub-clause 7.8, \"Content
  Streams and Resources,\" discusses PDF content streams and their
  associated resources.

| +===============+=======================================+ |
+===========================================================+

> **Figure 1 -- PDF Components**

In addition, this clause describes some data structures, built from
basic objects, that are so widely used that they can almost be
considered basic object types in their own right. These objects are
covered in: 7.9, \"Common Data Structures\"; 7.10, \"Functions\"; and
7.11, \"File Specifications.\"

NOTE Variants of PDF's object and file syntax are also used as the basis
for other file formats. These include the Forms Data Format (FDF),
described in 12.7.7, \"Forms Data Format\", and the Portable Job Ticket
Format (PJTF), described in Adobe Technical Note #5620, *Portable Job
Ticket Format*.

###  7.2 Lexical Conventions

**7.2.1 General**

At the most fundamental level, a PDF file is a sequence of bytes. These
bytes can be grouped into *tokens* according to the syntax rules
described in this sub-clause. One or more tokens are assembled to form
higherlevel syntactic entities, principally *objects*, which are the
basic data values from which a PDF document is constructed.

A non-encrypted PDF can be entirely represented using byte values
corresponding to the visible printable subset of the character set
defined in ANSI X3.4-1986, plus white space characters. However, a PDF
file is not restricted to the ASCII character set; it may contain
arbitrary bytes, subject to the following considerations:

- The tokens that delimit objects and that describe the structure of a
  PDF file shall use the ASCII character set. In addition all the
  reserved words and the names used as keys in PDF standard dictionaries
  and certain types of arrays shall be defined using the ASCII character
  set.

- The data values of strings and streams objects may be written either
  entirely using the ASCII character set or entirely in binary data. In
  actual practice, data that is naturally binary, such as sampled
  images, is usually represented in binary for compactness and
  efficiency.

- A PDF file containing binary data shall be transported as a binary
  file rather than as a text file to insure that all bytes of the file
  are faithfully preserved.

NOTE 1 A binary file is not portable to environments that impose
reserved character codes, maximum line lengths, endof-line conventions,
or other restrictions

NOTE 2 In this clause, the usage of the term character is entirely
independent of any logical meaning that the value may have when it is
treated as data in specific contexts, such as representing
human-readable text or selecting a glyph from a font.

**7.2.2 Character Set**

The PDF character set is divided into three classes, called *regular*,
*delimiter*, and *white-space* characters. This classification
determines the grouping of characters into tokens. The rules defined in
this sub-clause apply to all characters in the file except within
strings, streams, and comments.

The *White-space characters* shown in Table 1 separate syntactic
constructs such as names and numbers from each other. All white-space
characters are equivalent, except in comments, strings, and streams. In
all other contexts, PDF treats any sequence of consecutive white-space
characters as one character.

> **Table 1 -- White-space characters**

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  **Decimal**   **Hexadecimal**   **Octal**   **Name**
  ------------- ----------------- ----------- -----------------
  0             00                000         Null (NUL)

  9             09                011         HORIZONTAL TAB
                                              (HT)

  10            0A                012         LINE FEED (LF)

  12            0C                014         FORM FEED (FF)

  13            0D                015         CARRIAGE RETURN
                                              (CR)

  32            20                040         SPACE (SP)
  -------------------------------------------------------------

The CARRIAGE RETURN (0Dh) and LINE FEED (0Ah) characters, also called
*newline characters*, shall be treated as *end-of-line* (EOL) markers.
The combination of a CARRIAGE RETURN followed immediately by a LINE FEED
shall be treated as one EOL marker. EOL markers may be treated the same
as any other whitespace characters. However, sometimes an EOL marker is
required or recommended---that is, preceding a token that must appear at
the beginning of a line.

NOTE The examples in this standard use a convention that arranges tokens
into lines. However, the examples' use of white space for indentation is
purely for clarity of exposition and need not be included in practical
use.

The *delimiter characters* (, ), \<, \>, \[, \], {, }, /, and % are
special (LEFT PARENTHESIS (28h), RIGHT PARENTHESIS (29h), LESS-THAN SIGN
(3Ch), GREATER-THAN SIGN (3Eh), LEFT SQUARE BRACKET (5Bh), RIGHT SQUARE
BRACKET (5Dh), LEFT CURLY BRACE (7Bh), RIGHT CURLY BRACE (07Dh), SOLIDUS
(2Fh) and PERCENT SIGN (25h), respectively). They delimit syntactic
entities such as arrays, names, and comments. Any of these characters
terminates the entity preceding it and is not included in the entity.
Delimiter characters are allowed within the scope of a string when
following the rules for composing strings; see 7.3.4.2, "Literal
Strings". The leading ( of a string does delimit a preceding entity and
the closing ) of a string delimits the string's end.

All characters except the white-space characters and delimiters are
referred to as *regular characters*. These characters include bytes that
are outside the ASCII character set. A sequence of consecutive regular
characters comprises a single token. PDF is case-sensitive;
corresponding uppercase and lowercase letters shall be considered
distinct.

**7.2.3 Comments**

Any occurrence of the PERCENT SIGN (25h) outside a string or stream
introduces a *comment*. The comment consists of all characters after the
PERCENT SIGN and up to but not including the end of the line, including
regular, delimiter, SPACE (20h), and HORZONTAL TAB characters (09h). A
conforming reader shall ignore comments, and treat them as single
white-space characters. That is, a comment separates the token preceding
it from the one following it.

EXAMPLE The PDF fragment in this example is syntactically equivalent to
just the tokens abc and 123.

> abc% comment ( /% ) blah blah blah
>
> 123

Comments (other than the %PDF--*n.m* and %%EOF comments described in
7.5, \"File Structure\") have no semantics. They are not necessarily
preserved by applications that edit PDF files.

###  7.3 Objects

**7.3.1 General**

PDF includes eight basic types of objects: Boolean values, Integer and
Real numbers, Strings, Names, Arrays, Dictionaries, Streams, and the
null object.

Objects may be labelled so that they can be referred to by other
objects. A labelled object is called an indirect object (see 7.3.10,
\"Indirect Objects\").

Each object type, their method of creation and their proper referencing
as indirect objects is described in 7.3.2, \"Boolean Objects\" through
7.3.10, \"Indirect Objects.\"

**7.3.2 Boolean Objects**

*Boolean objects* represent the logical values of true and false. They
appear in PDF files using the keywords **true** and **false**.

**7.3.3 Numeric Objects**

PDF provides two types of numeric objects: integer and real. *Integer
objects* represent mathematical integers. *Real objects* represent
mathematical real numbers. The range and precision of numbers may be
limited by the internal representations used in the computer on which
the conforming reader is running; Annex C gives these limits for typical
implementations.

An integer shall be written as one or more decimal digits optionally
preceded by a sign. The value shall be interpreted as a signed decimal
integer and shall be converted to an integer object.

EXAMPLE 1 Integer objects

> 123 43445 +17 -98 0

A real value shall be written as one or more decimal digits with an
optional sign and a leading, trailing, or embedded PERIOD (2Eh) (decimal
point). The value shall be interpreted as a real number and shall be
converted to a real object.

EXAMPLE 2 Real objects

> 34.5 -3.62 +123.6 4. -.002 0.0

NOTE 1 A conforming writer shall not use the PostScript syntax for
numbers with non-decimal radices (such as 16#FFFE) or in exponential
format (such as 6.02E23).

NOTE 2 Throughout this standard, the term *number* refers to an object
whose type may be either integer or real. Wherever a real number is
expected, an integer may be used instead. For example, it is not
necessary to write the number 1.0 in real format; the integer 1 is
sufficient.

**7.3.4 String Objects**

**7.3.4.1 General**

A *string object* shall consist of a series of zero or more bytes.
String objects are not integer objects, but are stored in a more compact
format. The length of a string may be subject to implementation limits;
see Annex C.

String objects shall be written in one of the following two ways:

- As a sequence of literal characters enclosed in parentheses ( ) (using
  LEFT PARENTHESIS (28h) and RIGHT PARENThESIS (29h)); see 7.3.4.2,
  \"Literal Strings.\"

- As hexadecimal data enclosed in angle brackets \< \> (using LESS-THAN
  SIGN (3Ch) and GREATERTHAN SIGN (3Eh)); see 7.3.4.3, \"Hexadecimal
  Strings.\"

NOTE In many contexts, conventions exist for the interpretation of the
contents of a string value. This sub-clause defines only the basic
syntax for writing a string as a sequence of bytes; conventions or rules
governing the contents of strings in particular contexts are described
with the definition of those particular contexts.

7.9.2, \"String Object Types,\" describes the encoding schemes used for
the contents of string objects.

**7.3.4.2 Literal Strings**

A *literal string* shall be written as an arbitrary number of characters
enclosed in parentheses. Any characters may appear in a string except
unbalanced parentheses (LEFT PARENHESIS (28h) and RIGHT PARENTHESIS
(29h)) and the backslash (REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch)), which shall be treated
specially as described in this sub-clause. Balanced pairs of parentheses
within a string require no special treatment.

EXAMPLE 1 The following are valid literal strings:

> ( This is a string )
>
> ( Strings may contain newlines
>
> and such . )
>
> ( Strings may contain balanced parentheses ( ) and
>
> special characters ( \* ! & } \^ % and so on ) . )
>
> ( The following is an empty string . )
>
> ( )
>
> ( It has zero ( 0 ) length . )

Within a literal string, the REVERSE SOLIDUS is used as an escape
character. The character immediately following the REVERSE SOLIDUS
determines its precise interpretation as shown in Table 3. If the
character following the REVERSE SOLIDUS is not one of those shown in
Table 3, the REVERSE SOLIDUS shall be ignored.

> **Table 3 -- Escape sequences in literal strings**

  -------------------------------------------------
  **Sequence**   **Meaning**
  -------------- ----------------------------------
  \\n            LINE FEED (0Ah) (LF)

  \\r            CARRIAGE RETURN (0Dh) (CR)

  \\t            HORIZONTAL TAB (09h) (HT)

  \\b            BACKSPACE (08h) (BS)

  \\f            FORM FEED (FF)

  \\(            LEFT PARENTHESIS (28h)

  \\)            RIGHT PARENTHESIS (29h)

  \\\\           REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch) (Backslash)

  \\*ddd*        Character code *ddd* (octal)
  -------------------------------------------------

A conforming writer may split a literal string across multiple lines.
The REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch) (backslash character) at the end of a line
shall be used to indicate that the string continues on the following
line. A conforming reader shall disregard the REVERSE SOLIDUS and the
end-of-line marker following it when reading the string; the resulting
string value shall be identical to that which would be read if the
string were not split.

EXAMPLE 2 ( These \\

> two strings \\ are the same . )
>
> ( These two strings are the same . )

An end-of-line marker appearing within a literal string without a
preceding REVERSE SOLIDUS shall be treated as a byte value of (0Ah),
irrespective of whether the end-of-line marker was a CARRIAGE RETURN
(0Dh), a LINE FEED (0Ah), or both.

EXAMPLE 3 ( This string has an end-of-line at the end of it .

> )
>
> ( So does this one .\\n )

The \\*ddd* escape sequence provides a way to represent characters
outside the printable ASCII character set.

EXAMPLE 4 ( This string contains \\245two octal characters\\307 . )

The number *ddd* may consist of one, two, or three octal digits;
high-order overflow shall be ignored. Three octal digits shall be used,
with leading zeros as needed, if the next character of the string is
also a digit.

EXAMPLE 5 the literal

> ( \\0053 ) denotes a string containing two characters, \\005
> (Control-E) followed by the digit 3, whereas both
>
> ( \\053 ) and
>
> ( \\53 )
>
> denote strings containing the single character \\053, a plus sign (+).

Since any 8-bit value may appear in a string (with proper escaping for
REVERSE SOLIDUS (backslash) and unbalanced PARENTHESES) this \\ddd
notation provides a way to specify characters outside the ASCII
character set by using ASCII characters only. However, any 8-bit value
may appear in a string, represented either as itself or with the \\ddd
notation described.

When a document is encrypted (see 7.6, "Encryption"), all of its strings
are encrypted; the encrypted string values contain arbitrary 8-bit
values. When writing encrypted strings using the literal string form,
the conforming writer shall follow the rules described. That is, the
REVERSE SOLIDUS character shall be used as an escape to specify
unbalanced PARENTHESES or the REVERSE SOLIDUS character itself. The
REVERSE SOLIDUS may, but is not required, to be used to specify other,
arbitrary 8-bit values.

**7.3.4.3 Hexadecimal Strings**

Strings may also be written in hexadecimal form, which is useful for
including arbitrary binary data in a PDF file. A hexadecimal string
shall be written as a sequence of hexadecimal digits (0--9 and either
A--F or a--f) encoded as ASCII characters and enclosed within angle
brackets (using LESS-THAN SIGN (3Ch) and GREATERTHAN SIGN (3Eh)).

EXAMPLE 1 \< 4E6F762073686D6F7A206B6120706F702E \>

Each pair of hexadecimal digits defines one byte of the string.
White-space characters (such as SPACE (20h), HORIZONTAL TAB (09h),
CARRIAGE RETURN (0Dh), LINE FEED (0Ah), and FORM FEED (0Ch)) shall be
ignored.

If the final digit of a hexadecimal string is missing---that is, if
there is an odd number of digits---the final digit shall be assumed to
be 0.

EXAMPLE 2 \< 901FA3 \>

> is a 3-byte string consisting of the characters whose hexadecimal
> codes are 90, 1F, and A3, but
>
> \< 901FA \> is a 3-byte string containing the characters whose
> hexadecimal codes are 90, 1F, and A0.

**7.3.5 Name Objects**

Beginning with PDF 1.2 a *name object* is an atomic symbol uniquely
defined by a sequence of any characters (8-bit values) except null
(character code 0). *Uniquely defined* means that any two name objects
made up of the same sequence of characters denote the same object.
*Atomic* means that a name has no internal structure; although it is
defined by a sequence of characters, those characters are not considered
elements of the name.

When writing a name in a PDF file, a SOLIDUS (2Fh) (/) shall be used to
introduce a name. The SOLIDUS is not part of the name but is a prefix
indicating that what follows is a sequence of characters representing
the name in the PDF file and shall follow these rules:

a)  A NUMBER SIGN (23h) (#) in a name shall be written by using its
    2-digit hexadecimal code (23), preceded by the NUMBER SIGN.

b)  Any character in a name that is a regular character (other than
    NUMBER SIGN) shall be written as itself or by using its 2-digit
    hexadecimal code, preceded by the NUMBER SIGN.

c)  Any character that is not a regular character shall be written using
    its 2-digit hexadecimal code, preceded by the NUMBER SIGN only.

NOTE 1 There is not a unique encoding of names into the PDF file because
regular characters may be coded in either of two ways.

White space used as part of a name shall always be coded using the
2-digit hexadecimal notation and no white space may intervene between
the SOLIDUS and the encoded name.

Regular characters that are outside the range EXCLAMATION MARK(21h) (!)
to TILDE (7Eh) (\~) should be written using the hexadecimal notation.

The token SOLIDUS (a slash followed by no regular characters) introduces
a unique valid name defined by the empty sequence of characters.

NOTE 2 The examples shown in Table 4 and containing \# are not valid
literal names in PDF 1.0 or 1.1.

> **Table 4 -- Examples of literal names**

  /A#42                                   AB
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In PDF, literal names shall always be introduced by the SOLIDUS
character (/), unlike keywords such as **true**, **false**, and **obj**.

NOTE 3 This standard follows a typographic convention of writing names
without the leading SOLIDUS when they appear in running text and tables.
For example, **Type** and **FullScreen** denote names that would
actually be written in a PDF file (and in code examples in this
standard) as **/Type** and **/FullScreen.**

The length of a name shall be subject to an implementation limit; see
Annex C. The limit applies to the number of characters in the name's
internal representation. For example, the name /A#20B has three
characters (A, SPACE, B), not six.

As stated above, name objects shall be treated as atomic within a PDF
file. Ordinarily, the bytes making up the name are never treated as text
to be presented to a human user or to an application external to a
conforming reader. However, occasionally the need arises to treat a name
object as text, such as one that represents a font name (see the
**BaseFont** entry in Table 111), a colorant name in a separation or
DeviceN colour space, or a structure type (see 14.7.3, \"Structure
Types\").

In such situations, the sequence of bytes (after expansion of NUMBER
SIGN sequences, if any) should be interpreted according to UTF-8, a
variable-length byte-encoded representation of Unicode in which the
printable ASCII characters have the same representations as in ASCII.
This enables a name object to represent text virtually in any natural
language, subject to the implementation limit on the length of a name.

NOTE 4 PDF does not prescribe what UTF-8 sequence to choose for
representing any given piece of externally specified text as a name
object. In some cases, multiple UTF-8 sequences may represent the same
logical text. Name objects defined by different sequences of bytes
constitute distinct name objects in PDF, even though the UTF-8 sequences
may have identical external interpretations.

**7.3.6 Array Objects**

An *array object* is a one-dimensional collection of objects arranged
sequentially. Unlike arrays in many other computer languages, PDF arrays
may be heterogeneous; that is, an array's elements may be any
combination of numbers, strings, dictionaries, or any other objects,
including other arrays. An array may have zero elements.

An array shall be written as a sequence of objects enclosed in SQUARE
BRACKETS (using LEFT SQUARE BRACKET (5Bh) and RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET
(5Dh)).

EXAMPLE \[ 549 3.14 false ( Ralph ) /SomeName \]

PDF directly supports only one-dimensional arrays. Arrays of higher
dimension can be constructed by using arrays as elements of arrays,
nested to any depth.

**7.3.7 Dictionary Objects**

A *dictionary object* is an associative table containing pairs of
objects, known as the dictionary's *entries*. The first element of each
entry is the *key* and the second element is the *value*. The key shall
be a name (unlike dictionary keys in PostScript, which may be objects of
any type). The value may be any kind of object, including another
dictionary. A dictionary entry whose value is **null** (see 7.3.9,
\"Null Object\") shall be treated the same as if the entry does not
exist. (This differs from PostScript, where **null** behaves like any
other object as the value of a dictionary entry.) The number of entries
in a dictionary shall be subject to an implementation limit; see Annex
C. A dictionary may have zero entries.

The entries in a dictionary represent an associative table and as such
shall be unordered even though an arbitrary order may be imposed upon
them when written in a file. That ordering shall be ignored.

Multiple entries in the same dictionary shall not have the same key.

A dictionary shall be written as a sequence of key-value pairs enclosed
in double angle brackets (\<\< ... \>\>) (using LESS-THAN SIGNs (3Ch)
and GREATER-THAN SIGNs (3Eh)).

EXAMPLE \<\< /Type /Example

/Subtype /DictionaryExample

/Version 0 . 01

> /IntegerItem 12

/StringItem ( a string )

/Subdictionary \<\< /Item1 0 . 4

/Item2 true

/LastItem ( not ! )

/VeryLastItem ( OK )

> \>\> \>\>

NOTE Do not confuse the double angle brackets with single angle brackets
(\< and \>) (using LESS-THAN SIGN (3Ch) and GREATER-THAN SIGN (3Eh)),
which delimit a hexadecimal string (see 7.3.4.3, \"Hexadecimal
Strings\").

Dictionary objects are the main building blocks of a PDF document. They
are commonly used to collect and tie together the attributes of a
complex object, such as a font or a page of the document, with each
entry in the dictionary specifying the name and value of an attribute.
By convention, the **Type** entry of such a dictionary, if present,
identifies the type of object the dictionary describes. In some cases, a
**Subtype** entry (sometimes abbreviated **S**) may be used to further
identify a specialized subcategory of the general type. The value of the
**Type** or **Subtype** entry shall always be a name. For example, in a
font dictionary, the value of the **Type** entry shall always be *Font*,
whereas that of the **Subtype** entry may be *Type1*, *TrueType*, or one
of several other values.

The value of the **Type** entry can almost always be inferred from
context. The value of an entry in a page\'s font resource dictionary,
for example, shall be a font object; therefore, the **Type** entry in a
font dictionary serves primarily as documentation and as information for
error checking. The **Type** entry shall not be required unless so
stated in its description; however, if the entry is present, it shall
have the correct value. In addition, the value of the **Type** entry in
any dictionary, even in private data, shall be either a name defined in
this standard or a registered name; see Annex E for details.

**7.3.8 Stream Objects**

**7.3.8.1 General**

A *stream object*, like a string object, is a sequence of bytes.
Furthermore, a stream may be of unlimited length, whereas a string shall
be subject to an implementation limit. For this reason, objects with
potentially large amounts of data, such as images and page descriptions,
shall be represented as streams.

NOTE 1 This sub-clause describes only the syntax for writing a stream as
a sequence of bytes. The context in which a stream is referenced
determines what the sequence of bytes represent.

A stream shall consist of a dictionary followed by zero or more bytes
bracketed between the keywords **stream** (followed by newline) and
**endstream**:

EXAMPLE *dictionary*

> **stream**
>
> ... *Zero or more bytes* ... **endstream**

All streams shall be indirect objects (see 7.3.10, \"Indirect Objects\")
and the stream dictionary shall be a direct object. The keyword
**stream** that follows the stream dictionary shall be followed by an
end-of-line marker consisting of either a CARRIAGE RETURN and a LINE
FEED or just a LINE FEED, and not by a CARRIAGE RETURN alone. The
sequence of bytes that make up a stream lie between the end-of-line
marker following the **stream** keyword and the **endstream** keyword;
the stream dictionary specifies the exact number of bytes. There should
be an end-of-line marker after the data and before **endstream**; this
marker shall not be included in the stream length. There shall not be
any extra bytes, other than white space, between endstream and endobj.

Alternatively, beginning with PDF 1.2, the bytes may be contained in an
external file, in which case the stream dictionary specifies the file,
and any bytes between **stream** and **endstream** shall be ignored by a
conforming reader.

NOTE 2 Without the restriction against following the keyword **stream**
by a CARRIAGE RETURN alone, it would be impossible to differentiate a
stream that uses CARRIAGE RETURN as its end-of-line marker and has a
LINE FEED as its first byte of data from one that uses a CARRIAGE
RETURN--LINE FEED sequence to denote endof-line.

Table 5 lists the entries common to all stream dictionaries; certain
types of streams may have additional dictionary entries, as indicated
where those streams are described. The optional entries regarding
*filters* for the stream indicate whether and how the data in the stream
shall be transformed (decoded) before it is used. Filters are described
further in 7.4, \"Filters.\"

**7.3.8.2 Stream Extent**

Every stream dictionary shall have a **Length** entry that indicates how
many bytes of the PDF file are used for the stream's data. (If the
stream has a filter, **Length** shall be the number of bytes of
*encoded* data.) In addition, most filters are defined so that the data
shall be self-limiting; that is, they use an encoding scheme in which an
explicit *end-of-data* (EOD) marker delimits the extent of the data.
Finally, streams are used to represent many objects from whose
attributes a length can be inferred. All of these constraints shall be
consistent.

EXAMPLE An image with 10 rows and 20 columns, using a single colour
component and 8 bits per component, requires exactly 200 bytes of image
data. If the stream uses a filter, there shall be enough bytes of
encoded data in the PDF file to produce those 200 bytes. An error occurs
if **Length** is too small, if an explicit EOD marker occurs too soon,
or if the decoded data does not contain 200 bytes.

It is also an error if the stream contains too much data, with the
exception that there may be an extra end-of-line marker in the PDF file
before the keyword **endstream**.

+-----------+-----------+-----------------------------------+

**7.3.9 Null Object**

The *null object* has a type and value that are unequal to those of any
other object. There shall be only one object of type null, denoted by
the keyword **null**. An indirect object reference (see 7.3.10,
\"Indirect Objects\") to a nonexistent object shall be treated the same
as a null object. Specifying the null object as the value of a
dictionary entry (7.3.7, \"Dictionary Objects\") shall be equivalent to
omitting the entry entirely.

**7.3.10 Indirect Objects**

Any object in a PDF file may be labelled as an *indirect object*. This
gives the object a unique *object identifier* by which other objects can
refer to it (for example, as an element of an array or as the value of a
dictionary entry). The object identifier shall consist of two parts:

- A positive integer *object number*. Indirect objects may be numbered
  sequentially within a PDF file, but this is not required; object
  numbers may be assigned in any arbitrary order.

- A non-negative integer *generation number*. In a newly created file,
  all indirect objects shall have generation numbers of 0. Nonzero
  generation numbers may be introduced when the file is later updated;
  see subclauses 7.5.4, \"Cross-Reference Table\" and 7.5.6,
  \"Incremental Updates.\"

Together, the combination of an object number and a generation number
shall uniquely identify an indirect object.

The definition of an indirect object in a PDF file shall consist of its
object number and generation number (separated by white space), followed
by the value of the object bracketed between the keywords **obj** and
**endobj**.

EXAMPLE 1 Indirect object definition

> 12 0 obj
>
> ( Brillig ) endobj
>
> Defines an indirect string object with an object number of 12, a
> generation number of 0, and the value
>
> Brillig.

The object may be referred to from elsewhere in the file by an *indirect
reference.* Such indirect references shall consist of the object number,
the generation number, and the keyword **R** (with white space
separating each part):

> 12 0 R

Beginning with PDF 1.5, indirect objects may reside in object streams
(see 7.5.7, \"Object Streams\"). They are referred to in the same way;
however, their definition shall not include the keywords **obj** and
**endobj**, and their generation number shall be zero.

An indirect reference to an undefined object shall not be considered an
error by a conforming reader; it shall be treated as a reference to the
null object.

EXAMPLE 2 If a file contains the indirect reference 17 0 R but does not
contain the corresponding definition then the indirect reference is
considered to refer to the null object.

Except were documented to the contrary any object value may be a direct
or an indirect reference; the semantics are equivalent.

EXAMPLE 3 The following shows the use of an indirect object to specify
the length of a stream. The value of the stream's Length entry is an
integer object that follows the stream in the file. This allows
applications that generate PDF in a single pass to defer specifying the
stream's length until after its contents have been generated.

7.  0 obj

\<\< /Length 8 0 R \>\> % An indirect reference to object 8

> stream
>
> BT
>
> /F1 12 Tf
>
> 72 712 Td
>
> ( A stream with an indirect length ) Tj ET endstream endobj

8.  0 obj

77 % The length of the preceding stream

> endobj

### 7.4 Filters

**7.4.1 General**

Stream filters are introduced in 7.3.8, \"Stream Objects.\" An option
when reading stream data is to decode it using a filter to produce the
original non-encoded data. Whether to do so and which decoding filter or
filters to use may be specified in the stream dictionary.

EXAMPLE 1 If a stream dictionary specifies the use of an ASCIIHexDecode
filter, an application reading the data in that stream should transform
the ASCII hexadecimal-encoded data in that stream in order to obtain the
original binary data.

A conforming writer may encode data in a stream (for example, data for
sampled images) to compress it or to convert it to a portable ASCII
representation (or both). A conforming reader shall invoke the
corresponding decoding filter or filters to convert the information back
to its original form.

The filter or filters for a stream shall be specified by the **Filter**
entry in the stream's dictionary (or the **FFilter** entry if the stream
is external). Filters may be cascaded to form a *pipeline* that passes
the stream through two or more decoding transformations in sequence. For
example, data encoded using LZW and ASCII base-85 encoding (in that
order) shall be decoded using the following entry in the stream
dictionary:

EXAMPLE 2 /Filter \[ /ASCII85Decode /LZWDecode \]

Some filters may take parameters to control how they operate. These
optional parameters shall be specified by the **DecodeParms** entry in
the stream's dictionary (or the **FDecodeParms** entry if the stream is
external).

PDF supports a standard set of filters that fall into two main
categories:

- *ASCII filters* enable decoding of arbitrary binary data that has been
  encoded as ASCII text (see 7.2, \"Lexical Conventions,\" for an
  explanation of why this type of encoding might be useful).

- *Decompression filters* enable decoding of data that has been
  compressed. The compressed data shall be in binary format, even if the
  original data is ASCII text.

NOTE 1 ASCII filters serve no useful purpose in a PDF file that is
encrypted; see 7.6, "Encryption".

NOTE 2 Compression is particularly valuable for large sampled images,
since it reduces storage requirements and transmission time. Some types
of compression are lossy, meaning that some data is lost during the
encoding, resulting in a loss of quality when the data is decompressed.
Compression in which no loss of data occurs is called lossless. Though
somehow obvious it might be worth pointing out that lossy compression
can only be applied to sampled image data (and only certain types of
lossy compression for certain types of images). Lossless compression on
the other hand can be used for any kind of stream.

The standard filters are summarized in Table 6, which also indicates
whether they accept any optional parameters. The following sub-clauses
describe these filters and their parameters (if any) in greater detail,
including specifications of encoding algorithms for some filters.

**7.4.2 ASCIIHexDecode Filter**

The **ASCIIHexDecode** filter decodes data that has been encoded in
ASCII hexadecimal form. ASCII hexadecimal encoding and ASCII base-85
encoding (7.4.3, \"ASCII85Decode Filter\") convert binary data, such as
image data or previously compressed data, to 7-bit ASCII characters.

NOTE ASCII base-85 encoding is preferred to ASCII hexadecimal encoding.
Base-85 encoding is preferred because it is more compact: it expands the
data by a factor of 4 : 5, compared with 1 : 2 for ASCII hexadecimal
encoding.

The **ASCIIHexDecode** filter shall produce one byte of binary data for
each pair of ASCII hexadecimal digits (0--9 and A--F or a--f). All
white-space characters (see 7.2, \"Lexical Conventions\") shall be
ignored. A GREATER-THAN SIGN (3Eh) indicates EOD. Any other characters
shall cause an error. If the filter encounters the EOD marker after
reading an odd number of hexadecimal digits, it shall behave as if a 0
(zero) followed the last digit.

**7.4.3 ASCII85Decode Filter**

The **ASCII85Decode** filter decodes data that has been encoded in ASCII
base-85 encoding and produces binary data. The following paragraphs
describe the process for encoding binary data in ASCII base-85; the
**ASCII85Decode** filter reverses this process.

The ASCII base-85 encoding shall use the ASCII characters ! through u
((21h) - (75h)) and the character z (7Ah), with the 2-character sequence
\~\> (7Eh)(3Eh) as its EOD marker. The **ASCII85Decode** filter shall
ignore all white-space characters (see 7.2, \"Lexical Conventions\").
Any other characters, and any character sequences that represent
impossible combinations in the ASCII base-85 encoding shall cause an
error.

Specifically, ASCII base-85 encoding shall produce 5 ASCII characters
for every 4 bytes of binary data. Each group of 4 binary input bytes,
(*b*~1~ *b*~2~ *b*~3~ *b*~4~ ), shall be converted to a group of 5
output bytes, (*c*~1~ *c*~2~ *c*~3~ *c*~4~ *c*~5~ ), using the relation

> (*^b^*~1~ × 256^3^) + (*^b^*~2~ × 256^2^) + (*^b^*~3~ × 256^1^) +
> *^b^*~4~ =
>
> (*c*~1~ × 85^4^) + (*c*~2~ × 85^3^) + (*c*~3~ × 85^2^) + (*c*~4~ ×
> 85^1^) + *c*

In other words, 4 bytes of binary data shall be interpreted as a
base-256 number and then shall be converted to a base-85 number. The
five bytes of the base-85 number shall then be converted to ASCII
characters by adding 33 (the ASCII code for the character ! ) to each.
The resulting encoded data shall contain only printable ASCII characters
with codes in the range 33 (!) to 117 (u). As a special case, if all
five bytes are 0, they shall be represented by the character with code
122 (z) instead of by five exclamation points ( ! ! ! ! ! ).

If the length of the data to be encoded is not a multiple of 4 bytes,
the last, partial group of 4 shall be used to produce a last, partial
group of 5 output characters. Given *n* (1, 2, or 3) bytes of binary
data, the encoder shall first append 4 - *n* zero bytes to make a
complete group of 4. It shall encode this group in the usual way, but
shall not apply the special z case. Finally, it shall write only the
first *n* + 1 characters of the resulting group of 5. These characters
shall be immediately followed by the \~\> EOD marker.

The following conditions shall never occur in a correctly encoded byte
sequence:

- The value represented by a group of 5 characters is greater than
  2^32^ - 1.

- A z character occurs in the middle of a group.

- A final partial group contains only one character.

**7.4.4 LZWDecode and FlateDecode Filters**

**7.4.4.1 General**

The **LZWDecode** and (*PDF 1.2*) **FlateDecode** filters have much in
common and are discussed together in this sub-clause. They decode data
that has been encoded using the LZW or Flate data compression method,
respectively:

- LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) is a variable-length, adaptive compression
  method that has been adopted as one of the standard compression
  methods in the *Tag Image File Format* (TIFF) standard. For details on
  LZW encoding see 7.4.4.2, \"Details of LZW Encoding.\"

- The Flate method is based on the public-domain zlib/deflate
  compression method, which is a variablelength Lempel-Ziv adaptive
  compression method cascaded with adaptive Huffman coding. It is fully
  defined in Internet RFCs 1950, ZLIB Compressed Data Format
  Specification, and 1951, DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification
  (see the Bibliography).

Both of these methods compress either binary data or ASCII text but
(like all compression methods) always produce binary data, even if the
original data was text.

The LZW and Flate compression methods can discover and exploit many
patterns in the input data, whether the data is text or images. As
described later, both filters support optional transformation by a
*predictor function*, which improves the compression of sampled image
data.

|      | > the effects of PNG tags as with Flate encoding.          |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+

**7.4.4.2 Details of LZW Encoding**

Data encoded using the LZW compression method shall consist of a
sequence of codes that are 9 to 12 bits long. Each code shall represent
a single character of input data (0--255), a clear-table marker (256),
an EOD marker (257), or a table entry representing a multiple-character
sequence that has been encountered previously in the input (258 or
greater).

Initially, the code length shall be 9 bits and the LZW table shall
contain only entries for the 258 fixed codes. As encoding proceeds,
entries shall be appended to the table, associating new codes with
longer and longer sequences of input characters. The encoder and the
decoder shall maintain identical copies of this table.

Whenever both the encoder and the decoder independently (but
synchronously) realize that the current code length is no longer
sufficient to represent the number of entries in the table, they shall
increase the number of bits per code by 1. The first output code that is
10 bits long shall be the one following the creation of table entry 511,
and similarly for 11 (1023) and 12 (2047) bits. Codes shall never be
longer than 12 bits; therefore, entry 4095 is the last entry of the LZW
table.

The encoder shall execute the following sequence of steps to generate
each output code:

a)  Accumulate a sequence of one or more input characters matching a
    sequence already present in the table.

> For maximum compression, the encoder looks for the longest such
> sequence.

b)  Emit the code corresponding to that sequence.

c)  Create a new table entry for the first unused code. Its value is the
    sequence found in step (a) followed by the next input character.

EXAMPLE 1 Suppose the input consists of the following sequence of ASCII
character codes:

> 45 45 45 45 45 65 45 45 45 66
>
> Starting with an empty table, the encoder proceeds as shown in Table

Codes shall be packed into a continuous bit stream, high-order bit
first. This stream shall then be divided into bytes, high-order bit
first. Thus, codes may straddle byte boundaries arbitrarily. After the
EOD marker (code value 257), any leftover bits in the final byte shall
be set to 0.

In the example above, all the output codes are 9 bits long; they would
pack into bytes as follows (represented in hexadecimal):

EXAMPLE 2 80 0B 60 50 22 0C 0C 85 01

To adapt to changing input sequences, the encoder may at any point issue
a clear-table code, which causes both the encoder and the decoder to
restart with initial tables and a 9-bit code length. The encoder shall
begin by issuing a clear-table code. It shall issue a clear-table code
when the table becomes full; it may do so sooner.

**7.4.4.3 LZWDecode and FlateDecode Parameters**

The **LZWDecode** and **FlateDecode** filters shall accept optional
parameters to control the decoding process.

NOTE Most of these parameters are related to techniques that reduce the
size of compressed sampled images (rectangular arrays of colour values,
described in 8.9, \"Images\"). For example, image data typically changes
very little from sample to sample. Therefore, subtracting the values of
adjacent samples (a process called differencing), and encoding the
differences rather than the raw sample values, can reduce the size of
the output data. Furthermore, when the image data contains several
colour components (red-green-blue or cyanmagenta-yellow-black) per
sample, taking the difference between the values of corresponding
components in adjacent samples, rather than between different colour
components in the same sample, often reduces the output data size.

Table 8 shows the parameters that may optionally be specified for
**LZWDecode** and **FlateDecode** filters. Except where otherwise noted,
all values supplied to the decoding filter for any optional parameters
shall match those used when the data was encoded.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**         **Type**   **Value**
  --------------- ---------- ---------------------------------------
  **Predictor**   integer    A code that selects the predictor
                             algorithm, if any. If the value of this
                             entry is 1, the filter shall assume
                             that the normal algorithm was used to
                             encode the data, without prediction. If
                             the value is greater than 1, the filter
                             shall assume that the data was
                             differenced before being encoded, and
                             **Predictor** selects the predictor
                             algorithm. For more information
                             regarding **Predictor** values greater
                             than 1, see 7.4.4.4, \"LZW and Flate

                                    length increases shall be postponed as

                                    code length increases shall occur one
                                    code early. This parameter is included
                                    because LZW sample code distributed by
                                    some vendors increases the code length
                                    one code earlier than necessary.
                                    Default value: 1.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**7.4.4.4 LZW and Flate Predictor Functions**

LZW and Flate encoding compress more compactly if their input data is
highly predictable. One way of increasing the predictability of many
continuous-tone sampled images is to replace each sample with the
difference between that sample and a predictor function applied to
earlier neighboring samples. If the predictor function works well, the
postprediction data clusters toward 0.

PDF supports two groups of predictor functions. The first, the *TIFF*
group, consists of the single function that is Predictor 2 in the TIFF
6.0 specification.

NOTE 1 (In the TIFF 6.0 specification, Predictor 2 applies only to LZW
compression, but here it applies to Flate compression as well.) TIFF
Predictor 2 predicts that each colour component of a sample is the same
as the corresponding colour component of the sample immediately to its
left.

The second supported group of predictor functions, the *PNG* group,
consists of the filters of the World Wide Web Consortium's Portable
Network Graphics recommendation, documented in Internet RFC 2083, PNG
(Portable Network Graphics) Specification (see the Bibliography).

The term predictors is used here instead of filters to avoid confusion.

There are five basic PNG predictor algorithms (and a sixth that chooses
the optimum predictor function separately for each row).

              Sub on all rows)

  15          PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG
              optimum)
  ----------------------------------------------

The two groups of predictor functions have some commonalities. Both make
the following assumptions:

- Data shall be presented in order, from the top row to the bottom row
  and, within a row, from left to right.

- A row shall occupy a whole number of bytes, rounded up if necessary.

- Samples and their components shall be packed into bytes from
  high-order to low-order bits.

- All colour components of samples outside the image (which are
  necessary for predictions near the boundaries) shall be 0.

The predictor function groups also differ in significant ways:

- The postprediction data for each PNG-predicted row shall begin with an
  explicit algorithm tag; therefore, different rows can be predicted
  with different algorithms to improve compression. TIFF Predictor 2 has
  no such identifier; the same algorithm applies to all rows.

- The TIFF function group shall predict each colour component from the
  prior instance of that component, taking into account the number of
  bits per component and components per sample. In contrast, the PNG
  function group shall predict each byte of data as a function of the
  corresponding byte of one or more previous image samples, regardless
  of whether there are multiple colour components in a byte or whether a
  single colour component spans multiple bytes.

NOTE 2 This can yield significantly better speed at the cost of somewhat
worse compression.

**7.4.5 RunLengthDecode Filter**

The **RunLengthDecode** filter decodes data that has been encoded in a
simple byte-oriented format based on run length. The encoded data shall
be a sequence of *runs*, where each run shall consist of a *length* byte
followed by 1 to 128 bytes of data. If the *length* byte is in the range
0 to 127, the following *length* + 1 (1 to 128) bytes shall be copied
literally during decompression. If *length* is in the range 129 to 255,
the following single byte shall be copied 257 - *length* (2 to 128)
times during decompression. A *length* value of 128 shall denote EOD.

NOTE The compression achieved by run-length encoding depends on the
input data. In the best case (all zeros), a compression of approximately
64 : 1 is achieved for long files. The worst case (the hexadecimal
sequence 00 alternating with FF) results in an expansion of 127 : 128.

**7.4.6 CCITTFaxDecode Filter**

The **CCITTFaxDecode** filter decodes image data that has been encoded
using either Group 3 or Group 4 CCITT facsimile (fax) encoding.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 CCITT encoding is designed to achieve efficient compression
         of monochrome (1 bit per pixel) image data at relatively
         low resolutions, and so is useful only for bitmap image
         data, not for colour images, grayscale images, or general
         data.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 The CCITT encoding standard is defined by the International
         Telecommunications Union (ITU), formerly known as the
         Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et
         Télégraphique (International Coordinating Committee for
         Telephony and Telegraphy). The encoding algorithm is not
         described in detail in this standard but can be found in
         ITU Recommendations T.4 and T.6 (see the Bibliography). For
         historical reasons, we refer to these documents as the
         CCITT standard.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

CCITT encoding is bit-oriented, not byte-oriented. Therefore, in
principle, encoded or decoded data need not end at a byte boundary. This
problem shall be dealt with in the following ways:

- Unencoded data shall be treated as complete scan lines, with unused
  bits inserted at the end of each scan line to fill out the last byte.
  This approach is compatible with the PDF convention for sampled image
  data.

- Encoded data shall ordinarily be treated as a continuous, unbroken bit
  stream. The **EncodedByteAlign** parameter (described in Table 11) may
  be used to cause each encoded scan line to be filled to a byte
  boundary.

NOTE 3 Although this is not prescribed by the CCITT standard and fax
machines never do this, some software packages find it convenient to
encode data this way.

- When a filter reaches EOD, it shall always skip to the next byte
  boundary following the encoded data.

The filter shall not perform any error correction or resynchronization,
except as noted for the **DamagedRowsBeforeError** parameter in Table
11.

Table 11 lists the optional parameters that may be used to control the
decoding. Except where noted otherwise, all values supplied to the
decoding filter by any of these parameters shall match those used when
the data was encoded.

+----------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+

NOTE 4 The compression achieved using CCITT encoding depends on the
data, as well as on the value of various optional parameters. For Group
3 one-dimensional encoding, in the best case (all zeros), each scan line
compresses to 4 bytes, and the compression factor depends on the length
of a scan line. If the scan line is 300 bytes long, a compression ratio
of approximately 75 : 1 is achieved. The worst case, an image of
alternating ones and zeros, produces an expansion of 2 : 9.

**7.4.7 JBIG2Decode Filter**

The **JBIG2Decode** filter *(PDF 1.4)* decodes monochrome (1 bit per
pixel) image data that has been encoded using JBIG2 encoding.

NOTE 1 [JBIG stands for the Joint Bi-Level Image Experts Group, a group
within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that
developed the format. JBIG2 is the second version of a standard
originally released as JBIG1.](http://www.jpeg.org/)

> [JBIG2 encoding, which provides for both lossy and lossless
> compression, is useful only for monochrome images, not for colour
> images, grayscale images, or general data. The algorithms used by the
> encoder, and the details of the format, are not described here. See
> ISO/IEC 11544 published standard for the current JBIG2 specification.
> Additional information can be found through the Web site for the JBIG
> and JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) committees at \<
> http://www.jpeg.org \>.](http://www.jpeg.org/)
>
> [In general, JBIG2 provides considerably better compression than the
> existing CCITT standard (discussed in](http://www.jpeg.org/) 7.4.6,
> \"CCITTFaxDecode Filter\"). The compression it achieves depends
> strongly on the nature of the image. Images of pages containing text
> in any language compress particularly well, with typical compression
> ratios of 20:1 to 50:1 for a page full of text.

The JBIG2 encoder shall build a table of unique symbol bitmaps found in
the image, and other symbols found later in the image shall be matched
against the table. Matching symbols shall be replaced by an index into
the table, and symbols that fail to match shall be added to the table.
The table itself shall be compressed using other means.

NOTE 2 This method results in high compression ratios for documents in
which the same symbol is repeated often, as is typical for images
created by scanning text pages. It also results in high compression of
white space in the image, which does not need to be encoded because it
contains no symbols.

> While best compression is achieved for images of text, the JBIG2
> standard also includes algorithms for compressing regions of an image
> that contain dithered halftone images (for example, photographs).

The JBIG2 compression method may also be used for encoding multiple
images into a single JBIG2 bit stream.

NOTE 3 Typically, these images are scanned pages of a multiple-page
document. Since a single table of symbol bitmaps is used to match
symbols across multiple pages, this type of encoding can result in
higher compression ratios than if each of the pages had been
individually encoded using JBIG2.

In general, an image may be specified in PDF as either an *image
XObject* or an *inline image* (as described in 8.9, \"Images\");
however, the **JBIG2Decode** filter shall not be used with inline
images.

This filter addresses both single-page and multiple-page JBIG2 bit
streams by representing each JBIG2 page as a PDF image, as follows:

- The filter shall use the embedded file organization of JBIG2. (The
  details of this and the other types of file organization are provided
  in an annex of the ISO specification.) The optional 2-byte combination
  (marker) mentioned in the specification shall not be used in PDF.
  JBIG2 bit streams in random-access organization should be converted to
  the embedded file organization. Bit streams in sequential organization
  need no reorganization, except for the mappings described below.

- The JBIG2 file header, end-of-page segments, and end-of-file segment
  shall not be used in PDF. These should be removed before the PDF
  objects described below are created.

- The image XObject to which the **JBIG2Decode** filter is applied shall
  contain all segments that are associated with the JBIG2 page
  represented by that image; that is, all segments whose segment page
  association field contains the page number of the JBIG2 page
  represented by the image. In the image XObject, however, the segment's
  page number should always be 1; that is, when each such segment is
  written to the XObject, the value of its segment page association
  field should be set to 1.

- If the bit stream contains global segments (segments whose segment
  page association field contains 0), these segments shall be placed in
  a separate PDF stream, and the filter parameter listed in Table 12
  should refer to that stream. The stream can be shared by multiple
  image XObjects whose JBIG2 encodings use the same global segments.

EXAMPLE 1 The following shows an image that was compressed using the
JBIG2 compression method and then encoded in ASCII hexadecimal
representation. Since the JBIG2 bit stream contains global segments,
these segments are placed in a separate PDF stream, as indicated by the
JBIG2Globals filter parameter.

The resulting PDF image object, then, contains the page information
segment and the immediate text region segment and refers to a
**JBIG2Globals** stream that contains the symbol dictionary segment.

**7.4.8 DCTDecode Filter**

The **DCTDecode** filter decodes grayscale or colour image data that has
been encoded in the JPEG baseline format. See Adobe Technical Note #5116
for additional information about the use of JPEG "markers."

NOTE 1 JPEG stands for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, a group
within the International Organization for Standardization that developed
the format; DCT stands for discrete cosine transform, the primary
technique used in the encoding.

> JPEG encoding is a lossy compression method, designed specifically for
> compression of sampled continuoustone images and not for general data
> compression.

Data to be encoded using JPEG shall consist of a stream of image
samples, each consisting of one, two, three, or four colour components.
The colour component values for a particular sample shall appear
consecutively. Each component value shall occupy a byte.

During encoding, several parameters shall control the algorithm and the
information loss. The values of these parameters, which include the
dimensions of the image and the number of components per sample, are
entirely under the control of the encoder and shall be stored in the
encoded data. **DCTDecode** may obtain the parameter values it requires
directly from the encoded data. However, in one instance, the parameter
need not be present in the encoded data but shall be specified in the
filter parameter dictionary; see Table 13.

NOTE 2 The details of the encoding algorithm are not presented here but
are in the ISO standard and in JPEG: Still Image Data Compression
Standard, by Pennebaker and Mitchell (see the Bibliography). Briefly,
the JPEG algorithm breaks an image up into blocks that are 8 samples
wide by 8 samples high. Each colour component in an image is treated
separately. A two-dimensional DCT is performed on each block. This
operation produces 64 coefficients, which are then quantized. Each
coefficient may be quantized with a different step size. It is this
quantization that results in the loss of information in the JPEG
algorithm. The quantized coefficients are then compressed.

+-----------------------+--------------------------------+
| NOTE 4                | Better compression is often    |
|                       | possible for colour spaces     |

|                       | chrominance separately than    |
|                       | for those that do not. The     |
|                       | RGB-to-YUV conversion provided |
|                       | by the filters is one attempt  |
|                       | to separate luminance and      |
|                       | chrominance; it conforms to    |
|                       | CCIR recommendation 601-1.     |
|                       | Other colour spaces, such as   |
|                       | the CIE 1976 L\*a\*b\* space,  |
|                       | may also achieve this          |
|                       | objective. The chrominance     |
|                       | components can then be         |
|                       | compressed more than the       |
|                       | luminance by using coarser     |
|                       | sampling or quantization, with |
|                       | no degradation in quality.     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------+

In addition to the baseline JPEG format, beginning with PDF 1.3, the
**DCTDecode** filter shall support the progressive JPEG extension. This
extension does not add any entries to the **DCTDecode** parameter
dictionary; the distinction between baseline and progressive JPEG shall
be represented in the encoded data.

NOTE 5 There is no benefit to using progressive JPEG for stream data
that is embedded in a PDF file. Decoding progressive JPEG is slower and
consumes more memory than baseline JPEG. The purpose of this feature is
to enable a stream to refer to an external file whose data happens to be
already encoded in progressive JPEG.

**7.4.9 JPXDecode Filter**

The **JPXDecode** filter *(PDF 1.5)* decodes data that has been encoded
using the JPEG2000 compression method, an ISO standard for the
compression and packaging of image data.

NOTE 1 JPEG2000 defines a wavelet-based method for image compression
that gives somewhat better size reduction than other methods such as
regular JPEG or CCITT. Although the filter can reproduce samples that
are losslessly compressed.

This filter shall only be applied to image XObjects, and not to inline
images (see 8.9, \"Images\"). It is suitable both for images that have a
single colour component and for those that have multiple colour
components. The colour components in an image may have different numbers
of bits per sample. Any value from 1 to 38 shall be allowed.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > From a single JPEG2000 data stream, multiple versions   |
| 2    | > of an image may be decoded. These different versions    |
|      | > form progressions along four degrees of freedom:        |
|      | > sampling resolution, colour depth, band, and location.  |
|      | > For example, with a resolution progression, a thumbnail |
|      | > version of the image may be decoded from the data,      |
|      | > followed by a sequence of other versions of the image,  |
|      | > each with approximately four times as many samples      |
|      | > (twice the width times twice the height) as the         |
|      | > previous one. The last version is the full-resolution   |
|      | > image.                                                  |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | Viewing and printing applications may gain performance    |
| 3    | benefits by using the resolution progression. If the      |
|      | full-resolution image is densely sampled, the application |
|      | may be able to select and decode only the data making up  |
|      | a lower-resolution version, thereby spending less time    |
|      | decoding. Fewer bytes need be processed, a particular     |
|      | benefit when viewing files over the Web. The tiling       |
|      | structure of the image may also provide benefits if only  |
|      | certain areas of an image need to be displayed or         |
|      | printed.                                                  |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > Information on these progressions is encoded in the     |
| 4    | > data; no decode parameters are needed to describe them. |
|      | > The decoder deals with any progressions it encounters   |
|      | > to deliver the correct image data. Progressions that    |
|      | > are of no interest may simply have performance          |
|      | > consequences.                                           |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

The JPEG2000 specifications define two widely used formats, JP2 and JPX,
for packaging the compressed image data. JP2 is a subset of JPX. These
packagings contain all the information needed to properly interpret the
image data, including the colour space, bits per component, and image
dimensions. In other words, they are complete descriptions of images (as
opposed to image data that require outside parameters for correct
interpretation). The **JPXDecode** filter shall expect to read a full
JPX file structure---either internal to the PDF file or as an external
file.

NOTE 5 To promote interoperability, the specifications define a subset
of JPX called JPX baseline (of which JP2 is also

> a subset). The complete details of the baseline set of JPX features
> are contained in ISO/IEC 15444-2, Information Technology---JPEG 2000
> Image Coding System: Extensions (see the Bibliography[). See also
> \<http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/\>.](http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/)

Data used in PDF image XObjects shall be limited to the JPX baseline set
of features, except for enumerated colour space 19 (CIEJab). In
addition, enumerated colour space 12 (CMYK), which is part of JPX but
not JPX baseline, shall be supported in a PDF.

A JPX file describes a collection of *channels* that are present in the
image data. A channel may have one of three types:

- An *ordinary* channel contains values that, when decoded, shall become
  samples for a specified colour component.

- An *opacity* channel provides samples that shall be interpreted as raw
  opacity information.

- A *premultiplied opacity* channel shall provide samples that have been
  multiplied into the colour samples of those channels with which it is
  associated.

Opacity and premultiplied opacity channels shall be associated with
specific colour channels. There shall not be more than one opacity
channel (of either type) associated with a given colour channel.

EXAMPLE It is possible for one opacity channel to apply to the red
samples and another to apply to the green and blue colour channels of an
RGB image.

NOTE 6 The method by which the opacity information is to be used is
explicitly not specified, although one possible method shows a normal
blending mode.

In addition to using opacity channels for describing transparency, JPX
files also have the ability to specify chroma-key transparency. A single
colour may be specified by giving an array of values, one value for each
colour channel. Any image location that matches this colour shall be
considered to be completely transparent.

Images in JPX files may have one of the following colour spaces:

- A predefined colour space, chosen from a list of *enumerated colour
  spaces*. (Two of these are actually families of spaces and parameters
  are included.)

- A restricted ICC profile. These are the only sorts of ICC profiles
  that are allowed in JP2 files.

- An input ICC profile of any sort defined by ICC-1.

- A *vendor-defined* colour space.

More than one colour space may be specified for an image, with each
space being tagged with a precedence and an approximation value that
indicates how well it represents the preferred colour space. In
addition, the image's colour space may serve as the foundation for a
palette of colours that are selected using samples coming from the
image's data channels: the equivalent of an **Indexed** colour space in
PDF.

There are other features in the JPX format beyond describing a simple
image. These include provisions for describing layering and giving
instructions on composition, specifying simple animation, and including
generic XML metadata (along with JPEG2000-specific schemas for such
data). Relevant metadata should be replicated in the image dictionary's
**Metadata** stream in XMP format (see 14.3.2, \"Metadata Streams\").

When using the **JPXDecode** filter with image XObjects, the following
changes to and constraints on some entries in the image dictionary shall
apply (see 8.9.5, \"Image Dictionaries\" for details on these entries):

- **Width** and **Height** shall match the corresponding width and
  height values in the JPEG2000 data.

- **ColorSpace** shall be optional since JPEG2000 data contain colour
  space specifications. If present, it shall determine how the image
  samples are interpreted, and the colour space specifications in the
  JPEG2000 data shall be ignored. The number of colour channels in the
  JPEG2000 data shall match the number of components in the colour
  space; a conforming writer shall ensure that the samples are
  consistent with the colour space used.

- Any colour space other than **Pattern** may be specified. If an
  **Indexed** colour space is used, it shall be subject to the PDF limit
  of 256 colours. If the colour space does not match one of JPX's
  enumerated colour spaces (for example, if it has two colour components
  or more than four), it should be specified as a vendor colour space in
  the JPX data.

- If **ColorSpace** is not present in the image dictionary, the colour
  space information in the JPEG2000 data shall be used. A JPEG2000 image
  within a PDF shall have one of: the baseline JPX colorspaces; or
  enumerated colorspace 19 (CIEJab) or enumerated colorspace 12 (CMYK);
  or at least one ICC profile that is valid within PDF. Conforming PDF
  readers shall support the JPX baseline set of enumerated colour
  spaces; they shall also be responsible for dealing with the
  interaction between the colour spaces and the bit depth of samples.

- If multiple colour space specifications are given in the JPEG2000
  data, a conforming reader should attempt to use the one with the
  highest precedence and best approximation value. If the colour space
  is given by an unsupported ICC profile, the next lower colour space,
  in terms of precedence and approximation value, shall be used. If no
  supported colour space is found, the colour space used shall be
  DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, or DeviceCMYK, depending on the whether the
  number of channels in the JPEG2000 data is 1,3, or 4.

- **SMaskInData** specifies whether soft-mask information packaged with
  the image samples shall be used (see 11.6.5.3, \"Soft-Mask Images\");
  if it is, the **SMask** entry shall not be present. If **SMaskInData**
  is nonzero, there shall be only one opacity channel in the JPEG2000
  data and it shall apply to all colour channels.

- **Decode** shall be ignored, except in the case where the image is
  treated as a mask; that is, when **ImageMask** is **true**. In this
  case, the JPEG2000 data shall provide a single colour channel with
  1-bit samples.

**7.4.10 Crypt Filter**

The **Crypt** filter *(PDF 1.5)* allows the document-level security
handler (see 7.6, \"Encryption\") to determine which algorithms should
be used to decrypt the input data. The **Name** parameter in the decode
parameters dictionary for this filter (see Table 14) shall specify which
of the named crypt filters in the document (see 7.6.5, \"Crypt
Filters\") shall be used. The Crypt filter shall be the first filter in
the Filter array entry.

> **Table 14 -- Optional parameters for Crypt filters**

+----------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| **Key**  | **Type** | **Value**                             |
+:=========+:=========+=======================================+
| **Type** | name     | *(Optional)* If present, shall be     |
|          |          | **CryptFilterDecodeParms** for a      |
|          |          | **Crypt** filter decode parameter     |
|          |          | dictionary.                           |
+----------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| **Name** | name     | *(Optional)* The name of the crypt    |
|          |          | filter that shall be used to decrypt  |
|          |          | this stream. The name shall           |
|          |          | correspond to an entry in the **CF**  |
|          |          | entry of the encryption dictionary    |
|          |          | (see Table 20) or one of the standard |
|          |          | crypt filters (see Table 26).         |
|          |          |                                       |
|          |          | Default value: **Identity**.          |
+----------+----------+---------------------------------------+

In addition, the decode parameters dictionary may include entries that
are private to the security handler. Security handlers may use
information from both the crypt filter decode parameters dictionary and
the crypt filter dictionaries (see Table 25) when decrypting data or
providing a key to decrypt data.

NOTE When adding private data to the decode parameters dictionary,
security handlers should name these entries in conformance with the PDF
name registry (see Annex E).

If a stream specifies a crypt filter, then the security handler does not
apply \"Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES
algorithms\" in 7.6.2, \"General Encryption Algorithm,\" to the key
prior to decrypting the stream. Instead, the security handler shall
decrypt the stream using the key as is. Sub-clause 7.4, \"Filters,\"
explains how a stream specifies filters.

### 7.5 File Structure

**7.5.1 General**

This sub-clause describes how objects are organized in a PDF file for
efficient random access and incremental update. A basic conforming PDF
file shall be constructed of following four elements (see Figure 2):

- A one-line *header* identifying the version of the PDF specification
  to which the file conforms

- A *body* containing the objects that make up the document contained in
  the file

- A *cross-reference table* containing information about the indirect
  objects in the file

- A *trailer* giving the location of the cross-reference table and of
  certain special objects within the body of the

> file

This initial structure may be modified by later updates, which append
additional elements to the end of the file; see 7.5.6, \"Incremental
Updates,\" for details.

+-----------------------+
| +-------------------+ |
| | Header            | |
| +:=================:+ |
| | Body              | |
| +-------------------+ |
| | > Cross-reference | |
| | > table           | |
| +-------------------+ |
| | Trailer           | |
| +-------------------+ |
+=======================+

> **Figure 2 -- Initial structure of a PDF file**

As a matter of convention, the tokens in a PDF file are arranged into
lines; see 7.2, \"Lexical Conventions.\" Each line shall be terminated
by an end-of-line (EOL) marker, which may be a CARRIAGE RETURN (0Dh), a
LINE FEED (0Ah), or both. PDF files with binary data may have
arbitrarily long lines.

NOTE To increase compatibility with compliant programs that process PDF
files, lines that are not part of stream object data are limited to no
more than 255 characters, with one exception. Beginning with PDF 1.3,
the Contents string of a signature dictionary (see 12.8, \"Digital
Signatures\") is not subject to the restriction on line length.

The rules described here are sufficient to produce a basic conforming
PDF file. However, additional rules apply to organizing a PDF file to
enable efficient incremental access to a document's components in a
network environment. This form of organization, called *Linearized PDF*,
is described in Annex F.

**7.5.2 File Header**

The first line of a PDF file shall be a *header* consisting of the 5
characters %PDF-- followed by a version number of the form 1.N, where N
is a digit between 0 and 7.

A conforming reader shall accept files with any of the following
headers:

> %PDF--1. 0
>
> %PDF--1. 1
>
> %PDF--1. 2
>
> %PDF--1. 3
>
> %PDF--1. 4
>
> %PDF--1. 5
>
> %PDF--1. 6
>
> %PDF--1. 7

Beginning with PDF 1.4, the **Version** entry in the document's catalog
dictionary (located via the **Root** entry in the file's trailer, as
described in 7.5.5, \"File Trailer\"), if present, shall be used instead
of the version specified in the Header.

NOTE This allows a conforming writer to update the version using an
incremental update (see 7.5.6, \"Incremental Updates\").

Under some conditions, a conforming reader may be able to process PDF
files conforming to a later version than it was designed to accept. New
PDF features are often introduced in such a way that they can safely be
ignored by a conforming reader that does not understand them (see I.2,
\"PDF Version Numbers\").

This part of ISO 32000 defines the Extensions entry in the document's
catalog dictionary. If present, it shall identify any developer-defined
extensions that are contained in this PDF file. See 7.12, "Extensions
Dictionary".

If a PDF file contains binary data, as most do (see 7.2, \"Lexical
Conventions\"), the header line shall be immediately followed by a
comment line containing at least four binary characters---that is,
characters whose codes are 128 or greater. This ensures proper behaviour
of file transfer applications that inspect data near the beginning of a
file to determine whether to treat the file's contents as text or as
binary.

**7.5.3 File Body**

The *body* of a PDF file shall consist of a sequence of indirect objects
representing the contents of a document. The objects, which are of the
basic types described in 7.3, \"Objects,\" represent components of the
document such as fonts, pages, and sampled images. Beginning with PDF
1.5, the body can also contain object streams, each of which contains a
sequence of indirect objects; see 7.5.7, \"Object Streams.\"

**7.5.4 Cross-Reference Table**

The *cross-reference table* contains information that permits random
access to indirect objects within the file so that the entire file need
not be read to locate any particular object. The table shall contain a
one-line entry for each indirect object, specifying the byte offset of
that object within the body of the file. (Beginning with PDF 1.5, some
or all of the cross-reference information may alternatively be contained
in cross-reference streams; see 7.5.8, \"Cross-Reference Streams.\")

NOTE 1 The cross-reference table is the only part of a PDF file with a
fixed format, which permits entries in the table to be accessed
randomly.

The table comprises one or more *cross-reference sections*. Initially,
the entire table consists of a single section (or two sections if the
file is linearized; see Annex F). One additional section shall be added
each time the file is incrementally updated (see 7.5.6, \"Incremental
Updates\").

Each cross-reference section shall begin with a line containing the
keyword **xref**. Following this line shall be one or more
*cross-reference subsections*, which may appear in any order. For a file
that has never been incrementally updated, the cross-reference section
shall contain only one subsection, whose object numbering begins at 0.

NOTE 2 The subsection structure is useful for incremental updates, since
it allows a new cross-reference section to be added to the PDF file,
containing entries only for objects that have been added or deleted.

Each cross-reference subsection shall contain entries for a contiguous
range of object numbers. The subsection shall begin with a line
containing two numbers separated by a SPACE (20h), denoting the object
number of the first object in this subsection and the number of entries
in the subsection.

EXAMPLE 1 The following line introduces a subsection containing five
objects numbered consecutively from 28 to 32.

> 28 5

A given object number shall not have an entry in more than one
subsection within a single section.

Following this line are the cross-reference entries themselves, one per
line. Each entry shall be exactly 20

bytes long, including the end-of-line marker. There are two kinds of
cross-reference entries: one for objects that are in use and another for
objects that have been deleted and therefore are free. Both types of
entries have similar basic formats, distinguished by the keyword **n**
(for an in-use entry) or **f** (for a free entry). The format of an
in-use entry shall be:

*nnnnnnnnnn* *ggggg* **n** *eol* where:

> *nnnnnnnnnn* shall be a 10-digit byte offset in the decoded stream
> *ggggg* shall be a 5-digit generation number **n** shall be a keyword
> identifying this as an in-use entry *eol* shall be a 2-character
> end-of-line sequence

The byte offset in the decoded stream shall be a 10-digit number, padded
with leading zeros if necessary, giving the number of bytes from the
beginning of the file to the beginning of the object. It shall be
separated from the generation number by a single SPACE. The generation
number shall be a 5-digit number, also padded with leading zeros if
necessary. Following the generation number shall be a single SPACE, the
keyword **n**, and a 2-character end-of-line sequence consisting of one
of the following: SP CR, SP LF, or CR LF. Thus, the overall length of
the entry shall always be exactly 20 bytes.

The cross-reference entry for a free object has essentially the same
format, except that the keyword shall be **f** instead of **n** and the
interpretation of the first item is different:

*nnnnnnnnnn* *ggggg* **f** *eol* where:

> *nnnnnnnnnn* shall be the 10-digit object number of the next free
> object *ggggg* shall be a 5-digit generation number **f** shall be a
> keyword identifying this as a free entry *eol* shall be a 2-character
> end-of-line sequence

There are two ways an entry may be a member of the free entries list.
Using the basic mechanism the free entries in the cross-reference table
may form a linked list, with each free entry containing the object
number of the next. The first entry in the table (object number 0) shall
always be free and shall have a generation number of 65,535; it is shall
be the head of the linked list of free objects. The last free entry (the
tail of the linked list) links back to object number 0. Using the second
mechanism, the table may contain other free entries that link back to
object number 0 and have a generation number of 65,535, even though
these entries are not in the linked list itself.

Except for object number 0, all objects in the cross-reference table
shall initially have generation numbers of 0. When an indirect object is
deleted, its cross-reference entry shall be marked free and it shall be
added to the linked list of free entries. The entry's generation number
shall be incremented by 1 to indicate the generation number to be used
the next time an object with that object number is created. Thus, each
time the entry is reused, it is given a new generation number. The
maximum generation number is 65,535; when a crossreference entry reaches
this value, it shall never be reused.

The cross-reference table (comprising the original cross-reference
section and all update sections) shall contain one entry for each object
number from 0 to the maximum object number defined in the file, even if
one or more of the object numbers in this range do not actually occur in
the file.

EXAMPLE 2 The following shows a cross-reference section consisting of a
single subsection with six entries: four that are in use (objects number
1, 2, 4, and 5) and two that are free (objects number 0 and 3). Object
number 3 has been deleted, and the next object created with that object
number is given a generation number of 7.

> xref 0 6
>
> 0000000003 65535 f
>
> 0000000017 00000 n
>

>
> 0000000331 00000 n
>
> 0000000409 00000 n

EXAMPLE 3 The following shows a cross-reference section with four
subsections, containing a total of five entries. The first subsection
contains one entry, for object number 0, which is free. The second
subsection contains one entry, for object number 3, which is in use. The
third subsection contains two entries, for objects number 23 and 24,
both of which are in use. Object number 23 has been reused, as can be
seen from the fact that it has a generation number of 2. The fourth
subsection contains one entry, for object number 30, which is in use.

**7.5.5 File Trailer**

The *trailer* of a PDF file enables a conforming reader to quickly find
the cross-reference table and certain special objects. Conforming
readers should read a PDF file from its end. The last line of the file
shall contain only the end-of-file marker, **%%EOF**. The two preceding
lines shall contain, one per line and in order, the keyword
**startxref** and the byte offset in the decoded stream from the
beginning of the file to the beginning of the **xref** keyword in the
last cross-reference section. The **startxref** line shall be preceded
by the *trailer dictionary*, consisting of the keyword **trailer**
followed by a series of key-value pairs enclosed in double angle
brackets (\<\< ... \>\>) (using LESS-THAN SIGNs (3Ch) and GREATER-THAN
SIGNs (3Eh)). Thus, the trailer has the following overall structure:

> **trailer**
>
> \<\< *key*~1~ *value*~1~ *key*~2~ *value*~2~ ...
>
> *key~n~* *value~n~*
>
> \>\> **startxref**
>
> *Byte_offset_of_last_cross-reference_section*
>
> %%EOF

Table 15 lists the contents of the trailer dictionary.

**7.5.6 Incremental Updates**

The contents of a PDF file can be updated incrementally without
rewriting the entire file. When updating a PDF file incrementally,
changes shall be appended to the end of the file, leaving its original
contents intact.

NOTE 1 The main advantage to updating a file in this way is that small
changes to a large document can be saved quickly. There are additional
advantages:

> In certain contexts, such as when editing a document across an HTTP
> connection or using OLE embedding (a Windows-specific technology), a
> conforming writer cannot overwrite the contents of the original file.
> Incremental updates may be used to save changes to documents in these
> contexts.

NOTE 2 The resulting file has the structure shown in Figure 3. A
complete example of an updated file is shown in H.7, \"Updating
Example\".

A cross-reference section for an incremental update shall contain
entries only for objects that have been changed, replaced, or deleted.
Deleted objects shall be left unchanged in the file, but shall be marked
as deleted by means of their cross-reference entries. The added trailer
shall contain all the entries except the Prev entry (if present) from
the previous trailer, whether modified or not. In addition, the added
trailer dictionary shall contain a **Prev** entry giving the location of
the previous cross-reference section (see Table 15). Each trailer shall
be terminated by its own end-of-file (%%EOF) marker.

NOTE 3 As shown in Figure 3, a file that has been updated several times
contains several trailers. Because updates are appended to PDF files, a
file may have several copies of an object with the same object
identifier (object number and generation number).

EXAMPLE Several copies of an object can occur if a text annotation (see
12.5, \"Annotations\") is changed several times and the file is saved
between changes. Because the text annotation object is not deleted, it
retains the same object number and generation number as before. The
updated copy of the object is included in the new update section added
to the file.

The update's cross-reference section shall include a byte offset to this
new copy of the object, overriding the old byte offset contained in the
original cross-reference section. When a conforming reader reads the
file, it shall build its cross-reference information in such a way that
the most recent copy of each object shall be the one accessed from the
file.

In versions of PDF 1.4 or later a conforming writer may use the
**Version** entry in the document's catalog dictionary (see 7.7.2,
\"Document Catalog\") to override the version specified in the header. A
conforming writer may also need to update the Extensions dictionary, see
7.12, "Extensions Dictionary", if the update either deleted or added
developer-defined extensions.

NOTE 4 The version entry enables the version to be altered when
performing an incremental update.

> **Figure 3 -- Structure of an updated PDF file**

**7.5.7 Object Streams**

An *object stream*, is a stream object in which a sequence of indirect
objects may be stored, as an alternative to their being stored at the
outermost file level.

NOTE 1 Object streams are first introduced in PDF 1.5. The purpose of
object streams is to allow indirect objects other than streams to be
stored more compactly by using the facilities provided by stream
compression filters.

NOTE 2 The term "compressed object" is used regardless of whether the
stream is actually encoded with a compression filter.

The following objects shall not be stored in an object stream:

- Stream objects

- Objects with a generation number other than zero

- A document's encryption dictionary (see 7.6, \"Encryption\")

- An object representing the value of the **Length** entry in an object
  stream dictionary

- In linearized files (see Annex F), the document catalog, the
  linearization dictionary, and page objects shall not appear in an
  object stream.

NOTE 3 Indirect references to objects inside object streams use the
normal syntax: for example, 14 0 R. Access to these objects requires a
different way of storing cross-reference information; see 7.5.8,
\"Cross-Reference Streams.\" Use of compressed objects requires a PDF
1.5 conforming reader. However, compressed objects can be stored in a
manner that a PDF 1.4 conforming reader can ignore.

In addition to the regular keys for streams shown in Table 5, the stream
dictionary describing an object stream contains the following entries:

> **Table 16 -- Additional entries specific to an object stream
> dictionary**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **key**       **type**   **description**
  ------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------
  **Type**      name       *(Required)* The type of PDF object that
                           this dictionary describes; shall be
                           **ObjStm** for an object stream.

  **N**         integer    *(Required)* The number of indirect
                           objects stored in the stream.

  **First**     integer    *(Required)* The byte offset in the
                           decoded stream of the first compressed
                           object.

  **Extends**   stream     *(Optional)* A reference to another object
                           stream, of which the current object stream
                           shall be considered an extension. Both
                           streams are considered part of a
                           *collection* of object streams (see
                           below). A given collection consists of a
                           set of streams whose **Extends** links
                           form a directed acyclic graph.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

A conforming writer determines which objects, if any, to store in object
streams.

EXAMPLE 1 It can be useful to store objects having common
characteristics together, such as "fonts on page 1," or "Comments for
draft #3." These objects are known as a *collection*.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 4 To avoid a degradation of performance, such as would occur
         when downloading and decompressing a large object stream to
         access a single compressed object, the number of objects in
         an individual object stream should be limited. This may
         require a group of object streams to be linked as a
         collection, which can be done by means of the **Extends**
         entry in the object stream dictionary.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 5 **Extends** may also be used when a collection is being
         updated to include new objects. Rather than modifying the
         original object stream, which could entail duplicating much
         of the stream data, the new objects can be stored in a
         separate object stream. This is particularly important when
         adding an update section to a document.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

The stream data in an object stream shall contain the following items:

- **N** pairs of integers separated by white space, where the first
  integer in each pair shall represent the object number of a compressed
  object and the second integer shall represent the byte offset in the
  decoded stream of that object, relative to the first object stored in
  the object stream, the value of the stream\'s first entry. The offsets
  shall be in increasing order.

NOTE 6 There is no restriction on the order of objects in the object
stream; in particular, the objects need not be stored in object-number
order.

- The value of the **First** entry in the stream dictionary shall be the
  byte offset in the decoded stream of the first object.

- The **N** objects are stored consecutively. Only the object values are
  stored in the stream; the **obj** and **endobj** keywords shall not be
  used.

NOTE 7 A compressed dictionary or array may contain indirect references.

An object in an object stream shall not consist solely of an object
reference.

EXAMPLE 2 3 0 R

In an encrypted file (i.e., entire object stream is encrypted), strings
occurring anywhere in an object stream shall not be separately
encrypted.

A conforming writer shall store the first object immediately after the
last byte offset. A conforming reader shall rely on the **First** entry
in the stream dictionary to locate the first object.

An object stream itself, like any stream, shall be an indirect object,
and therefore, there shall be an entry for it in a cross-reference table
or cross-reference stream (see 7.5.8, \"Cross-Reference Streams\"),
although there might not be any references to it (of the form 243 0 R).

The generation number of an object stream and of any compressed object
shall be zero. If either an object stream or a compressed object is
deleted and the object number is freed, that object number shall be
reused only for an ordinary (uncompressed) object other than an object
stream. When new object streams and compressed objects are created, they
shall always be assigned new object numbers, not old ones taken from the
free list.

EXAMPLE 3 The following shows three objects (two fonts and a font
descriptor) as they would be represented in a PDF 1.4 or earlier file,
along with a cross-reference table.

11. 0 obj

> \<\< /Type /Font /Subtype /TrueType \...*other entries\...*

NOTE 8 For readability, the object stream has been shown unencoded. In a
real PDF 1.5 file, Flate encoding would typically be used to gain the

**7.5.8 Cross-Reference Streams**

**7.5.8.1 General**

Beginning with PDF 1.5, cross-reference information may be stored in a
*cross-reference stream* instead of in a cross-reference table.
Cross-reference streams provide the following advantages:

- A more compact representation of cross-reference information

- The ability to access compressed objects that are stored in object
  streams (see 7.5.7, \"Object Streams\") and to allow new
  cross-reference entry types to be added in the future

Cross-reference streams are stream objects (see 7.3.8, \"Stream
Objects\"), and contain a dictionary and a data stream. Each
cross-reference stream contains the information equivalent to the
cross-reference table (see 7.5.4, \"Cross-Reference Table\") and trailer
(see 7.5.5, \"File Trailer\") for one cross-reference section.

EXAMPLE In this example, the trailer dictionary entries are stored in
the stream dictionary, and the cross-reference table entries are stored
as the stream data.

The value following the **startxref** keyword shall be the offset of the
cross-reference stream rather than the **xref** keyword. For files that
use cross-reference streams entirely (that is, files that are not
hybrid-reference files; see 7.5.8.4, \"Compatibility with Applications
That Do Not Support Compressed Reference Streams\"), the keywords
**xref** and **trailer** shall no longer be used. Therefore, with the
exception of the **startxref** *address* **%%EOF** segment and comments,
a file may be entirely a sequence of objects.

In linearized files (see F.3, \"Linearized PDF Document Structure\"),
the document catalog, the linearization dictionary, and page objects
shall not appear in an object stream.

**7.5.8.2 Cross-Reference Stream Dictionary**

Cross-reference streams may contain the entries shown in Table 17 in
addition to the entries common to all streams (Table 5) and trailer
dictionaries (Table 15). Since some of the information in the
cross-reference stream is needed by the conforming reader to construct
the index that allows indirect references to be resolved, the entries in
cross-reference streams shall be subject to the following restrictions:

- The values of all entries shown in Table 17 shall be direct objects;
  indirect references shall not be permitted. For arrays (the **Index**
  and **W** entries), all of their elements shall be direct objects as
  well. If the stream is encoded, the **Filter** and **DecodeParms**
  entries in Table 5 shall also be direct objects.

- Other cross-reference stream entries not listed in Table 17 may be
  indirect; in fact, some (such as **Root** in Table 15) shall be
  indirect.

- The cross-reference stream shall not be encrypted and strings
  appearing in the cross-reference stream dictionary shall not be
  encrypted. It shall not have a **Filter** entry that specifies a
  **Crypt** filter (see 7.4.10, \"Crypt Filter\").

**7.5.8.3 Cross-Reference Stream Data**

Each entry in a cross-reference stream shall have one or more fields,
the first of which designates the entry's type (see Table 18). In PDF
1.5 through PDF 1.7, only types 0, 1, and 2 are allowed. Any other value
shall be interpreted as a reference to the null object, thus permitting
new entry types to be defined in the future.

The fields are written in increasing order of field number; the length
of each field shall be determined by the corresponding value in the
**W** entry (see Table 17). Fields requiring more than one byte are
stored with the high-order byte first.

                         be 0. Type 0 entries define the
                         linked list of free objects
                         (corresponding to **f** entries in
                         a cross-reference table).

             2           The object number of the next free

  1          1           The type of this entry, which shall
                         be 1. Type 1 entries define objects
                         that are in use but are not
                         compressed (corresponding to **n**
                         entries in a cross-reference
                         table).

             2           The byte offset of the object,
                         starting from the beginning of the
                         file.

             3           The generation number of the
                         object. Default value: 0.

  2          1           The type of this entry, which shall
                         be 2. Type 2 entries define
                         compressed objects.

             2           The object number of the object
                         stream in which this object is
                         stored. (The generation number of
                         the object stream shall be
                         implicitly 0.)

             3           The index of this object within the
                         object stream.
  ----------------------------------------------------------

Like any stream, a cross-reference stream shall be an indirect object.
Therefore, an entry for it shall exist in either a cross-reference
stream (usually itself) or in a cross-reference table (in
hybrid-reference files; see 7.5.8.4, \"Compatibility with Applications
That Do Not Support Compressed Reference Streams\").

**7.5.8.4 Compatibility with Applications That Do Not Support Compressed
Reference Streams**

Readers designed only to support versions of PDF before PDF 1.5, and
hence do not support cross-reference streams, cannot access objects that
are referenced by cross-reference streams. If a file uses
cross-reference streams exclusively, it cannot be opened by such
readers.

However, it is possible to construct a file called a *hybrid-reference*
file that is readable by readers designed only to support versions of
PDF before PDF 1.5. Such a file contains objects referenced by standard
crossreference tables in addition to objects in object streams that are
referenced by cross-reference streams.

In these files, the trailer dictionary may contain, in addition to the
entry for trailers shown in Table 15, an entry, as shown in Table 19.
This entry may be ignored by readers designed only to support versions
of PDF before PDF 1.5, which therefore have no access to entries in the
cross-reference stream the entry refers to.

> **Table 19 -- Additional entries in a hybrid-reference file's trailer
> dictionary**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**       **Type**   **Value**
  ------------- ---------- --------------------------------------------
  **XRefStm**   integer    *(Optional)* The byte offset in the decoded
                           stream from the beginning of the file of a
                           cross-reference stream.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Size** entry of the trailer shall be large enough to include all
objects, including those defined in the crossreference stream referenced
by the **XRefStm** entry. However, to allow random access, a main
cross-reference section shall contain entries for all objects numbered 0
through **Size** - 1 (see 7.5.4, \"Cross-Reference Table\"). Therefore,
the **XRefStm** entry shall not be used in the trailer dictionary of the
main cross-reference section but only in an update cross-reference
section.

When a conforming reader opens a hybrid-reference file, objects with
entries in cross-reference streams are not hidden. When the conforming
reader searches for an object, if an entry is not found in any given
standard cross-reference section, the search shall proceed to a
cross-reference stream specified by the **XRefStm** entry before looking
in the previous cross-reference section (the **Prev** entry in the
trailer).

Hidden objects, therefore, have two cross-reference entries. One is in
the cross-reference stream. The other is a free entry in some previous
section, typically the section referenced by the **Prev** entry. A
conforming reader shall look in the cross-reference stream first, shall
find the object there, and shall ignore the free entry in the previous
section. A reader designed only to support versions of PDF before PDF
1.5 ignores the crossreference stream and looks in the previous section,
where it finds the free entry. The free entry shall have a
next-generation number of 65535 so that the object number shall not be
reused.

There are limitations on which objects in a hybrid-reference file can be
hidden without making the file appear invalid to readers designed only
to support versions of PDF before PDF 1.5. In particular, the root of
the PDF file and the document catalog (see 7.7.2, \"Document Catalog\")
shall not be hidden, nor any object that is *visible from the root*.
Such objects can be determined by starting from the root and working
recursively:

- In any dictionary that is visible, direct objects shall be visible.
  The value of any required key-value pair shall be visible.

- In any array that is visible, every element shall be visible.

- Resource dictionaries in content streams shall be visible. Although a
  resource dictionary is not required, strictly speaking, the content
  stream to which it is attached is assumed to contain references to the
  resources.

In general, the objects that may be hidden are optional objects
specified by indirect references. A conforming reader can resolve those
references by processing the cross-reference streams. In a reader
designed only to support versions of PDF before PDF 1.5, the objects
appear to be free, and the references shall be treated as references to
the null object.

EXAMPLE 1 The **Outlines** entry in the catalog dictionary is optional.
Therefore, its value may be an indirect reference to a hidden object. A
reader designed only to support versions of PDF before PDF 1.5 treats it
as a reference to the null object, which is equivalent to having omitted
the entry entirely; a conforming reader recognizes it.

If the value of the **Outlines** entry is an indirect reference to a
visible object, the entire outline tree shall be visible because nodes
in the outline tree contain required pointers to other nodes.

Items that shall be visible include the entire page tree, fonts, font
descriptors, and width tables. Objects that may be hidden in a
hybrid-reference file include the structure tree, the outline tree,
article threads, annotations, destinations, Web Capture information, and
page labels,.

EXAMPLE 2 In this example, an **ASCIIHexDecode** filter is specified to
make the format and contents of the crossreference stream readable.

> This example shows a hybrid-reference file containing a main
> cross-reference section and an update cross-reference section with an
> **XRefStm** entry that points to a cross-reference stream (object 11),
> which in turn has references to an object stream (object 2).
>
> In this example, the catalog (object 1) contains an indirect reference
> (3 0 R) to the root of the structure tree. The search for the object
> starts at the update cross-reference table, which has no objects in
> it. The search proceeds depending on the version of the conforming
> reader.

One choice for a reader designed only to support versions of PDF before
PDF 1.5 is to continue the search by following the **Prev** pointer to
the main cross-reference table. That table defines object 3 as a free
object, which is treated as the **null** object. Therefore, the entry is
considered missing, and the document has no structure tree.

Another choice for a conforming reader, is to continue the search by
following the **XRefStm** pointer to the cross-reference stream (object
11). It defines object 3 as a compressed object, stored at index 0 in
the object stream (2 0 obj). Therefore, the document has a structure
tree.

The previous example illustrates several other points:

- The object stream is unencoded and the cross-reference stream uses an
  ASCII hexadecimal encoding for clarity. In practice, both streams
  should be Flate-encoded. PDF comments shall not be included in a
  crossreference table or in cross-reference streams.

- The hidden objects, 2 through 11, are numbered consecutively. In
  practice, hidden objects and other free items in a cross-reference
  table need not be linked in ascending order until the end.

- The update cross-reference table need not contain any entries. A
  conforming writer that uses the hybridreference format creates the
  main cross-reference table, the update cross-reference table, and the
  crossreference stream at the same time. Objects 12 and 13, for
  example, are not compressed. They might have entries in the update
  table. Since objects 2 and 11, the object stream and the
  cross-reference stream, are not compressed, they might also be defined
  in the update table. Since they are part of the hidden section,
  however, it makes sense to define them in the cross-reference stream.

- The update cross-reference section shall appear at the end of the
  file, but otherwise, there are no ordering restrictions on any of the
  objects or on the main cross-reference section. However, a file that
  uses both the hybrid-reference format and the linearized format has
  ordering requirements (see Annex F).

###  7.6 Encryption

**7.6.1 General**

A PDF document can be *encrypted* *(PDF 1.1)* to protect its contents
from unauthorized access. Encryption applies to all strings and streams
in the document\'s PDF file, with the following exceptions:

- The values for the ID entry in the trailer

- Any strings in an Encrypt dictionary

- Any strings that are inside streams such as content streams and
  compressed object streams, which themselves are encrypted

Encryption is not applied to other object types such as integers and
boolean values, which are used primarily to convey information about the
document\'s structure rather than its contents. Leaving these values
unencrypted allows random access to the objects within a document,
whereas encrypting the strings and streams protects the document\'s
contents.

When a PDF stream object (see 7.3.8, \"Stream Objects\") refers to an
external file, the stream's contents shall not be encrypted, since they
are not part of the PDF file itself. However, if the contents of the
stream are embedded within the PDF file (see 7.11.4, \"Embedded File
Streams\"), they shall be encrypted like any other stream in the file.
Beginning with PDF 1.5, embedded files can be encrypted in an otherwise
unencrypted document (see 7.6.5, \"Crypt Filters\").

Encryption-related information shall be stored in a document's
*encryption dictionary*, which shall be the value of the **Encrypt**
entry in the document's trailer dictionary (see Table 15). The absence
of this entry from the trailer dictionary means that a conforming reader
shall consider the document to be not encrypted. The entries shown in
Table 20 are common to all encryption dictionaries.

The encryption dictionary's **Filter** entry identifies the file's
*security handler*, a software module that implements various aspects of
the encryption process and controls access to the contents of the
encrypted document. PDF specifies a standard password-based security
handler that all conforming readers shall support, but conforming
readers can optionally provide additional security handlers of their
own.

The **SubFilter** entry specifies the syntax of the encryption
dictionary contents. It allows interoperability between handlers; that
is, a document can be decrypted by a handler other than the preferred
one (the **Filter** entry) if they both support the format specified by
**SubFilter**.

The **V** entry, in specifying which algorithm to use, determines the
length of the encryption key, on which the encryption (and decryption)
of data in a PDF file shall be based. For **V** values 2 and 3, the
**Length** entry specifies the exact length of the encryption key. In
PDF 1.5, a value of 4 for **V** permits the security handler to use its
own encryption and decryption algorithms and to specify *crypt filters*
to use on specific streams (see 7.6.5, \"Crypt Filters\").

The remaining contents of the encryption dictionary shall be determined
by the security handler and may vary from one handler to another.
Entries for the standard security handler are described in 7.6.3,
\"Standard Security Handler.\" Entries for public-key security handlers
are described in 7.6.4, \"Public-Key Security Handlers.\"

Unlike strings within the body of the document, those in the encryption
dictionary shall be direct objects. The contents of the encryption
dictionary shall not be encrypted (the algorithm specified by the **V**
entry). Security handlers shall be responsible for encrypting any data
in the encryption dictionary that they need to protect.

NOTE Conforming writers have two choices if the encryption methods and
syntax provided by PDF are not sufficient for their needs: they can
provide an alternate security handler or they can encrypt whole PDF
documents themselves, not making use of PDF security.

**7.6.2 General Encryption Algorithm**

One of the following algorithms shall be used when encrypting data in a
PDF file:

- [A proprietary encryption algorithm known as RC4. RC4 is a symmetric
  stream cipher: the same algorithm](http://www.rsasecurity.com/) [shall
  be used for both encryption and decryption, and the algorithm does not
  change the length of the data.](http://www.rsasecurity.com/) [RC4 is a
  copyrighted, proprietary algorithm of RSA Security, Inc. Independent
  software vendors may be](http://www.rsasecurity.com/) [required to
  license RC4 to develop software that encrypts or decrypts PDF
  documents. For further](http://www.rsasecurity.com/) information,
  visit the RSA Web site at \< http://www.rsasecurity.com \> or send
  e-mail to [\< p](http://www.rsasecurity.com/)roducts@rsasecurity.com
  \>.

- The AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm (beginning with PDF
  1.6). AES is a symmetric block cipher: the same algorithm shall be
  used for both encryption and decryption, and the length of the data
  when encrypted is rounded up to a multiple of the block size, which is
  fixed to always be 16 bytes, as specified in FIPS 197, *Advanced
  Encryption Standard (AES)*; see the Bibliography).

> Strings and streams encrypted with AES shall use a padding scheme that
> is described in Internet RFC 2898, *PKCS #5: Password-Based
> Cryptography Specification Version 2.0*; see the Bibliography. For an
> original message length of M, the pad shall consist of 16 - (M mod 16)
> bytes whose value shall also be 16 - (M mod 16).

EXAMPLE A 9-byte message has a pad of 7 bytes, each with the value 0x07.
The pad can be unambiguously removed to determine the original message
length when decrypting. Note that the pad is present when M is evenly
divisible by 16; it contains 16 bytes of 0x10.

PDF's standard encryption methods also make use of the MD5
message-digest algorithm for key generation purposes (described in
Internet RFC 1321, *The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm*; see the
Bibliography).

The encryption of data in a PDF file shall be based on the use of an
*encryption key* computed by the security handler. Different security
handlers compute the encryption key using their own mechanisms.
Regardless of how the key is computed, its use in the encryption of data
shall always be the same (see \"Algorithm 1:

Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES algorithms\"). Because the RC4
algorithm and AES algorithms are symmetric, this same sequence of steps
shall be used both to encrypt and to decrypt data.

Algorithms in 7.6, "Encryption" are uniquely numbered within that clause
in a manner that maintains compatibility with previous documentation.

> **Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES algorithms**

a)  Obtain the object number and generation number from the object
    identifier of the string or stream to be encrypted (see 7.3.10,
    \"Indirect Objects\"). If the string is a direct object, use the
    identifier of the indirect object containing it.

b)  For all strings and streams without crypt filter specifier; treating
    the object number and generation number as binary integers, extend
    the original *n*-byte encryption key to *n* + 5 bytes by appending
    the low-order 3 bytes of the object number and the low-order 2 bytes
    of the generation number in that order, low-order byte first. (*n*
    is 5 unless the value of **V** in the encryption dictionary is
    greater than 1, in which case *n* is the value of **Length** divided
    by 8.)

> If using the AES algorithm, extend the encryption key an additional 4
> bytes by adding the value "sAlT", which corresponds to the hexadecimal
> values 0x73, 0x41, 0x6C, 0x54. (This addition is done for backward
> compatibility and is not intended to provide additional security.)

c)  Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step (b) as
    input to this function.

d)  Use the first (*n* + 5) bytes, up to a maximum of 16, of the output
    from the MD5 hash as the key for the RC4 or AES symmetric key
    algorithms, along with the string or stream data to be encrypted.

> If using the AES algorithm, the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode,
> which requires an initialization vector, is used. The block size
> parameter is set to 16 bytes, and the initialization vector is a
> 16-byte random number that is stored as the first 16 bytes of the
> encrypted stream or string.
>
> The output is the encrypted data to be stored in the PDF file.

Stream data shall be encrypted after applying all stream encoding
filters and shall be decrypted before applying any stream decoding
filters. The number of bytes to be encrypted or decrypted shall be given
by the **Length** entry in the stream dictionary. Decryption of strings
(other than those in the encryption dictionary) shall be done after
escape-sequence processing and hexadecimal decoding as appropriate to
the string representation described in 7.3.4, \"String Objects.\"

**7.6.3 Standard Security Handler**

**7.6.3.1 General**

PDF's standard security handler shall allow *access permissions* and up
to two passwords to be specified for a document: an *owner password* and
a *user password*. An application's decision to encrypt a document shall
be based on whether the user creating the document specifies any
passwords or access restrictions.

EXAMPLE A conforming writer may have a security settings dialog box that
the user can invoke before saving the PDF file.

If passwords or access restrictions are specified, the document shall be
encrypted, and the permissions and information required to validate the
passwords shall be stored in the encryption dictionary. Documents in
which only file attachments are encrypted shall use the same password as
the *user* and *owner* password.

NOTE 1 A conforming writer may also create an encrypted document without
any user interaction if it has some other source of information about
what passwords and permissions to use.

If a user attempts to open an encrypted document that has a user
password, the conforming reader shall first try to authenticate the
encrypted document using the padding string defined in 7.6.3.3,
\"Encryption Key Algorithm\" (default user password):

- If this authentication attempt is successful, the conforming reader
  may open, decrypt and display the document on the screen.

- If this authentication attempt fails, the application should prompt
  for a password. Correctly supplying either password (*owner* or *user*
  password) should enable the user to open the document, decrypt it, and
  display it on the screen.

Whether additional operations shall be allowed on a decrypted document
depends on which password (if any) was supplied when the document was
opened and on any access restrictions that were specified when the
document was created:

- Opening the document with the correct *owner* password should allow
  full (owner) access to the document. This unlimited access includes
  the ability to change the document's passwords and access permissions.

- Opening the document with the correct *user* password (or opening a
  document with the default password) should allow additional operations
  to be performed according to the user access permissions specified in
  the document's encryption dictionary.

Access permissions shall be specified in the form of flags corresponding
to the various operations, and the set of operations to which they
correspond shall depend on the security handler's revision number (also
stored in the encryption dictionary). If the security handler's revision
number is 2 or greater, the operations to which user access can be
controlled shall be as follows:

- Modifying the document's contents

- Copying or otherwise extracting text and graphics from the document,
  including extraction for accessibility purposes (that is, to make the
  contents of the document accessible through assistive technologies
  such as screen readers or Braille output devices; see 14.9,
  \"Accessibility Support\"**.**

- Adding or modifying text annotations (see 12.5.6.4, \"Text
  Annotations\") and interactive form fields (see

> 12.7, \"Interactive Forms\")

- Printing the document

If the security handler's revision number is 3 or greater, user access
to the following operations shall be controlled more selectively:

- Filling in forms (that is, filling in existing interactive form
  fields) and signing the document (which amounts to filling in existing
  signature fields, a type of interactive form field).

- Assembling the document: inserting, rotating, or deleting pages and
  creating navigation elements such as bookmarks or thumbnail images
  (see 12.3, \"Document-Level Navigation\").

- Printing to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the
  PDF content could be generated. Disallowing such printing may result
  in degradation of output quality.

In addition, security handlers of revisions 3 and greater shall enable
the extraction of text and graphics (in support of accessibility to
users with disabilities or for other purposes) to be controlled
separately.

If a security handler of revision 4 is specified, the standard security
handler shall support crypt filters (see 7.6.5, \"Crypt Filters\"). The
support shall be limited to the **Identity** crypt filter (see Table 26)
and crypt filters named **StdCF** whose dictionaries contain a **CFM**
value of **V2** or **AESV2** and an **AuthEvent** value of **DocOpen**.
PublicKey security handlers in this case shall use crypt filters named
**DefaultCryptFilter** when all document content is encrypted, and shall
use crypt filters named **DefEmbeddedFile** when file attachments only
are encrypted in place of **StdCF** name. This nomenclature shall not be
used as indicator of the type of the security handler or encryption.

Once the document has been opened and decrypted successfully, a
conforming reader technically has access to the entire contents of the
document. There is nothing inherent in PDF encryption that enforces the
document permissions specified in the encryption dictionary. Conforming
readers shall respect the intent of the document creator by restricting
user access to an encrypted PDF file according to the permissions
contained in the file.

NOTE 2 PDF 1.5 introduces a set of access permissions that do not
require the document to be encrypted (see 12.8.4, \"Permissions\"). This
enables limited access to a document when a user is not be able to
respond to a prompt for a password. For example, there may be conforming
readers that do not have a person running them such as printing off-line
or on a server.

The values of the **O** and **U** entries in this dictionary shall be
used to determine whether a password entered when the document is opened
is the correct owner password, user password, or neither.

The value of the **P** entry shall be interpreted as an unsigned 32-bit
quantity containing a set of flags specifying which access permissions
shall be granted when the document is opened with user access. Table 22
shows the meanings of these flags. Bit positions within the flag word
shall be numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (highorder). A 1 bit in any
position shall enable the corresponding access permission. Which bits
shall be meaningful, and in some cases how they shall be interpreted,
shall depend on the security handler's revision number (specified in the
encryption dictionary's **R** entry).

Conforming readers shall ignore all flags other than those at bit
positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

NOTE PDF integer objects can be interpreted as binary values in a signed
twos-complement form. Since all the

> **7.6.3.3 Encryption Key Algorithm**

As noted earlier, one function of a security handler is to generate an
encryption key for use in encrypting and decrypting the contents of a
document. Given a password string, the standard security handler
computes an encryption key as shown in \"Algorithm 2: Computing an
encryption key\".

> **Algorithm 2: Computing an encryption key**

a)  Pad or truncate the password string to exactly 32 bytes. If the
    password string is more than 32 bytes long, use only its first 32
    bytes; if it is less than 32 bytes long, pad it by appending the
    required number of additional bytes from the beginning of the
    following padding string:

> \< 28 BF 4E 5E 4E 75 8A 41 64 00 4E 56 FF FA 01 08
>
> 2E 2E 00 B6 D0 68 3E 80 2F 0C A9 FE 64 53 69 7A \>
>
> That is, if the password string is *n* bytes long, append the first
> 32 - *n* bytes of the padding string to the end of the password
> string. If the password string is empty (zero-length), meaning there
> is no user password, substitute the entire padding string in its
> place.

b)  Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step (a) as
    input to this function.

c)  Pass the value of the encryption dictionary's **O** entry to the MD5
    hash function. (\"Algorithm 3: Computing the encryption dictionary's
    O (owner password) value\" shows how the **O** value is computed.)

d)  Convert the integer value of the **P** entry to a 32-bit unsigned
    binary number and pass these bytes to the MD5 hash function,
    low-order byte first.

e)  Pass the first element of the file's file identifier array (the
    value of the **ID** entry in the document's trailer dictionary; see
    Table 15) to the MD5 hash function.

NOTE The first element of the ID array generally remains the same for a
given document. However, in some situations, conforming writers may
regenerate the ID array if a new generation of a document is created.
Security handlers are encouraged not to rely on the ID in the encryption
key computation.

f)  *(Security handlers of revision 4 or greater)* If document metadata
    is not being encrypted, pass 4 bytes with the value 0xFFFFFFFF to
    the MD5 hash function.

g)  Finish the hash.

h)  *(Security handlers of revision 3 or greater)* Do the following 50
    times: Take the output from the previous MD5 hash and pass the first
    *n* bytes of the output as input into a new MD5 hash, where *n* is
    the number of bytes of the encryption key as defined by the value of
    the encryption dictionary's **Length** entry.

i)  Set the encryption key to the first *n* bytes of the output from the
    final MD5 hash, where *n* shall always be 5 for security handlers of
    revision 2 but, for security handlers of revision 3 or greater,
    shall depend on the value of the encryption dictionary's **Length**
    entry.

This algorithm, when applied to the user password string, produces the
encryption key used to encrypt or decrypt string and stream data
according to \"Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES
algorithms\" in 7.6.2, \"General Encryption Algorithm.\" Parts of this
algorithm are also used in the algorithms described below.

**7.6.3.4 Password Algorithms**

In addition to the encryption key, the standard security handler shall
provide the contents of the encryption dictionary (Table 20 and Table
21). The values of the **Filter**, **V**, **Length**, **R**, and **P**
entries are straightforward, but the computation of the **O** (owner
password) and **U** (user password) entries requires further
explanation. The algorithms 3 through 7 that follow show how the values
of the owner password and user password entries shall be computed (with
separate versions of the latter depending on the revision of the
security handler).

> **Algorithm 3: Computing the encryption dictionary's O (owner
> password) value**

a)  Pad or truncate the owner password string as described in step (a)
    of \"Algorithm 2: Computing an encryption key\". If there is no
    owner password, use the user password instead.

b)  Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step (a) as
    input to this function.

c)  *(Security handlers of revision 3 or greater)* Do the following 50
    times: Take the output from the previous MD5 hash and pass it as
    input into a new MD5 hash.

d)  Create an RC4 encryption key using the first *n* bytes of the output
    from the final MD5 hash, where *n* shall always be 5 for security
    handlers of revision 2 but, for security handlers of revision 3 or
    greater, shall depend on the value of the encryption dictionary's
    **Length** entry.

e)  Pad or truncate the user password string as described in step (a) of
    \"Algorithm 2: Computing an encryption key\".

f)  Encrypt the result of step (e), using an RC4 encryption function
    with the encryption key obtained in step

> (d).

g)  *(Security handlers of revision 3 or greater)* Do the following 19
    times: Take the output from the previous invocation of the RC4
    function and pass it as input to a new invocation of the function;
    use an encryption key generated by taking each byte of the
    encryption key obtained in step (d) and performing an XOR (exclusive
    or) operation between that byte and the single-byte value of the
    iteration counter (from 1 to 19).

h)  Store the output from the final invocation of the RC4 function as
    the value of the **O** entry in the encryption dictionary.

> **Algorithm 4: Computing the encryption dictionary's U (user password)
> value (Security handlers of revision 2)**

a)  Create an encryption key based on the user password string, as
    described in \"Algorithm 2: Computing an encryption key\".

b)  Encrypt the 32-byte padding string shown in step (a) of \"Algorithm
    2: Computing an encryption key\", using an RC4 encryption function
    with the encryption key from the preceding step.

c)  Store the result of step (b) as the value of the **U** entry in the
    encryption dictionary.

> **Algorithm 5: Computing the encryption dictionary's U (user password)
> value (Security handlers of revision 3 or greater)**

a)  Create an encryption key based on the user password string, as
    described in \"Algorithm 2: Computing an encryption key\".

b)  Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the 32-byte padding string
    shown in step (a) of \"Algorithm 2: Computing an encryption key\" as
    input to this function.

c)  Pass the first element of the file's file identifier array (the
    value of the **ID** entry in the document's trailer dictionary; see
    Table 15) to the hash function and finish the hash.

d)  Encrypt the 16-byte result of the hash, using an RC4 encryption
    function with the encryption key from step

> (a).

e)  Do the following 19 times: Take the output from the previous
    invocation of the RC4 function and pass it as input to a new
    invocation of the function; use an encryption key generated by
    taking each byte of the original encryption key obtained in step (a)
    and performing an XOR (exclusive or) operation between that byte and
    the single-byte value of the iteration counter (from 1 to 19).

f)  Append 16 bytes of arbitrary padding to the output from the final
    invocation of the RC4 function and store the 32-byte result as the
    value of the **U** entry in the encryption dictionary.

NOTE The standard security handler uses the algorithms 6 and 7 that
follow, to determine whether a supplied password string is the correct
user or owner password. Note too that algorithm 6 can be used to
determine whether a document's user password is the empty string, and
therefore whether to suppress prompting for a password when the document
is opened.

> **Algorithm 6: Authenticating the user password**

a)  Perform all but the last step of \"Algorithm 4: Computing the
    encryption dictionary's U (user password) value (Security handlers

    dictionary's U (user password) value (Security handlers of revision

b)  If the result of step (a) is equal to the value of the encryption
    dictionary's **U** entry (comparing on the first 16 bytes in the
    case of security handlers of revision 3 or greater), the password
    supplied is the correct user password. The key obtained in step (a)
    (that is, in the first step of \"Algorithm 4: Computing the
    encryption dictionary's U (user password) value (Security handlers
    of revision 2)\" or \"Algorithm 5: Computing the encryption
    dictionary's U (user password) value (Security handlers of revision
    3 or greater)\") shall be used to decrypt the document.

> **Algorithm 7: Authenticating the owner password**

a)  Compute an encryption key from the supplied password string, as
    described in steps (a) to (d) of \"Algorithm 3: Computing the
    encryption dictionary's O (owner password) value\".

b)  *(Security handlers of revision 2 only)* Decrypt the value of the
    encryption dictionary's **O** entry, using an RC4 encryption
    function with the encryption key computed in step (a).

c)  The result of step (b) purports to be the user password.
    Authenticate this user password using \"Algorithm 6: Authenticating
    the user password\". If it is correct, the password supplied is the
    correct owner password.

**7.6.4 Public-Key Security Handlers**

**7.6.4.1 General**

Security handlers may use *public-key* encryption technology to encrypt
a document (or strings and streams within a document). When doing so,
specifying one or more lists of recipients, where each list has its own
unique access permissions may be done. Only specified recipients shall
open the encrypted document or content, unlike the standard security
handler, where a password determines access. The permissions defined for
public-key security handlers are shown in Table 24 in 7.6.4.2,
\"Public-Key Encryption Dictionary\".

Public-key security handlers use the industry standard Public Key
Cryptographic Standard Number 7 (PKCS#7) binary encoding syntax to
encode recipient list, decryption key, and access permission
information. The PKCS#7 specification is in Internet RFC 2315, *PKCS #7:
Cryptographic Message Syntax, Version 1.5* (see the Bibliography).

When encrypting the data, each recipient's X.509 public key certificate
(as described in ITU-T Recommendation X.509; see the Bibliography) shall
be available. When decrypting the data, the conforming reader shall scan
the recipient list for which the content is encrypted and shall attempt
to find a match with a certificate that belongs to the user. If a match
is found, the user requires access to the corresponding private key,
which may require authentication, possibly using a password. Once access
is obtained, the private key shall be used to decrypt the encrypted
data.

**7.6.4.2 Public-Key Encryption Dictionary**

Encryption dictionaries for public-key security handlers contain the
common entries shown in Table 20, whose values are described above. In
addition, they may contain the entry shown in Table 23 as described
below.

The **Filter** entry shall be the name of a public-key security handler.

NOTE Examples of existing security handlers that support public-key
encryption are **Entrust.PPKEF**, **Adobe.PPKLite**, and
**Adobe.PubSec**. This handler will be the preferred handler when
encrypting the document.

Permitted values of the **SubFilter** entry for use with conforming
public-key security handlers are **adbe.pkcs7.s3**, **adbe.pkcs7.s4**,
which shall be used when not using crypt filters (see 7.6.5, \"Crypt
Filters\") and **adbe.pkcs7.s5**, which shall be used when using crypt
filters.

The **CF**, **StmF**, and **StrF** entries may be present when
**SubFilter** is **adbe.pkcs7.s5.**

**7.6.4.3 Public-Key Encryption Algorithms**

Figure 4 illustrates how PKCS#7 objects shall be used when encrypting
PDF files. A PKCS#7 object is designed to encapsulate and encrypt what
is referred to as the *enveloped data*.

> **Figure 4 -- Public-key encryption algorithm**

The enveloped data in the PKCS#7 object contains keying material that
shall be used to decrypt the document (or individual strings or streams
in the document, when crypt filters are used; see 7.6.5, \"Crypt
Filters\"). A key shall be used to encrypt (and decrypt) the enveloped
data. This key (the *plaintext key* in Figure 4) shall be encrypted for
each recipient, using that recipient's public key, and shall be stored
in the PKCS#7 object (as the *encrypted key* for each recipient). To
decrypt the document, that key shall be decrypted using the recipient's
private key, which yields a decrypted (plaintext) key. That key, in
turn, shall be used to decrypt the enveloped data in the PKCS#7 object,
resulting in a byte array that includes the following information:

- A 20-byte seed that shall be used to create the encryption key that is
  used by \"Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the RC4 or AES
  algorithms\". The seed shall be a unique random number generated by
  the security handler that encrypted the document.

- A 4-byte value defining the permissions, least significant byte first.
  See Table 24 for the possible permission values.

- When **SubFilter** is **adbe.pkcs7.s3**, the relevant permissions
  shall be only those specified for revision 2 of the standard security
  handler.

- For **adbe.pkcs7.s4**, security handlers of revision 3 permissions
  shall apply.

- For **adbe.pkcs7.s5**, which supports the use of crypt filters, the
  permissions shall be the same as **adbe.pkcs7.s4** when the crypt
  filter is referenced from the **StmF** or **StrF** entries of the
  encryption dictionary. When referenced from the **Crypt** filter
  decode parameter dictionary of a stream object (see Table 14), the 4
  bytes of permissions shall be absent from the enveloped data.

The algorithms that shall be used to encrypt the enveloped data in the
PKCS#7 object are: RC4 with key lengths up to 256-bits, DES, Triple DES,
RC2 with key lengths up to 128 bits, 128-bit AES in Cipher Block
Chaining (CBC) mode, 192-bit AES in CBC mode, 256-bit AES in CBC mode.
The PKCS#7 specification is in Internet RFC 2315, *PKCS #7:
Cryptographic Message Syntax, Version 1.5* (see the Bibliography).

The encryption key used by \"Algorithm 1: Encryption of data using the
RC4 or AES algorithms\" shall be calculated by means of an SHA-1 message
digest operation that digests the following data, in order: a) The 20
bytes of seed

b)  The bytes of each item in the **Recipients** array of PKCS#7 objects
    in the order in which they appear in the array

c)  4 bytes with the value 0xFF if the key being generated is intended
    for use in document-level encryption and the document metadata is
    being left as plaintext

The first *n*/8 bytes of the resulting digest shall be used as the
encryption key, where *n* is the bit length of the encryption key.

**7.6.5 Crypt Filters**

PDF 1.5 introduces *crypt filters,* which provide finer granularity
control of encryption within a PDF file. The use of crypt filters
involves the following structures:

- The encryption dictionary (see Table 20) contains entries that
  enumerate the crypt filters in the document (**CF**) and specify which
  ones are used by default to decrypt all the streams (**StmF**) and
  strings (**StrF**) in the document. In addition, the value of the
  **V** entry shall be 4 to use crypt filters.

- Each crypt filter specified in the **CF** entry of the encryption
  dictionary shall be represented by a *crypt filter dictionary*, whose
  entries are shown in Table 25.

- A stream filter type, the **Crypt** filter (see 7.4.10, \"Crypt
  Filter\") can be specified for any stream in the document to override
  the default filter for streams. A conforming reader shall provide a
  standard **Identity** filter which shall pass the data unchanged (see
  Table 26) to allow specific streams, such as document metadata, to be
  unencrypted in an otherwise encrypted document. The stream's
  **DecodeParms** entry shall contain a **Crypt** filter decode
  parameters dictionary (see Table 14) whose **Name** entry specifies
  the particular crypt filter to be used (if missing, **Identity** is
  used). Different streams may specify different crypt filters.

Authorization to decrypt a stream shall always be obtained before the
stream can be accessed. This typically occurs when the document is
opened, as specified by a value of **DocOpen** for the **AuthEvent**
entry in the crypt filter dictionary. Conforming readers and security
handlers shall treat any attempt to access a stream for which
authorization has failed as an error. **AuthEvent** can also be
**EFOpen**, which indicates the presence of an embedded file that is
encrypted with a crypt filter that may be different from the crypt
filters used by default to encrypt strings and streams in the document.

In the file specification dictionary (see 7.11.3, \"File Specification
Dictionaries\"), related files (**RF**) shall use the same crypt filter
as the embedded file (**EF**).

A value of **None** for the **CFM** entry in the crypt filter dictionary
allows the security handler to do its own decryption. This allows the
handler to tightly control key management and use any preferred
symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm.

### 7.7 Document Structure

**7.7.1 General**

A PDF document can be regarded as a hierarchy of objects contained in
the body section of a PDF file. At the root of the hierarchy is the
document's *catalog* dictionary (see 7.7.2, \"Document Catalog\").

NOTE Most of the objects in the hierarchy are dictionaries. Figure 5
illustrates the structure of the object hierarchy.

EXAMPLE Each page of the document is represented by a *page object*---a
dictionary that includes references to the page's contents and other
attributes, such as its thumbnail image (12.3.4, \"Thumbnail Images\")
and any annotations (12.5, \"Annotations\") associated with it. The
individual page objects are tied together in a structure called the
*page tree* (described in 7.7.3, \"Page Tree\"), which in turn is
specified by an indirect reference in the document catalog. Parent,
child, and sibling relationships within the hierarchy are defined by
dictionary entries whose values are indirect references to other
dictionaries.

The data structures described in this sub-clause, particularly the
**Catalog** and **Page** dictionaries, combine entries describing
document structure with ones dealing with the detailed semantics of
documents and pages. All entries are listed here, but many of their
descriptions are deferred to subsequent sub-clauses.

**7.7.2 Document Catalog**

The root of a document's object hierarchy is the *catalog* dictionary,
located by means of the **Root** entry in the trailer of the PDF file
(see 7.5.5, \"File Trailer\"). The catalog contains references to other
objects defining the document's contents, outline, article threads,
named destinations, and other attributes. In addition, it contains
information about how the document shall be displayed on the screen,
such as whether its outline and thumbnail page images shall be displayed
automatically and whether some location other than the first page shall
be shown when the document is opened. Table 28 shows the entries in the
catalog dictionary.

**7.7.3 Page Tree**

**7.7.3.1 General**

The pages of a document are accessed through a structure known as the
*page tree*, which defines the ordering of pages in the document. Using
the tree structure, conforming readers using only limited memory, can
quickly open a document containing thousands of pages. The tree contains
nodes of two types---intermediate nodes, called *page tree nodes*, and
leaf nodes, called *page objects*---whose form is described in the
subsequent subclauses. Conforming products shall be prepared to handle
any form of tree structure built of such nodes.

NOTE The simplest structure can consist of a single page tree node that
references all of the document's page objects directly. However, to
optimize application performance, a conforming writer can construct
trees of a particular form, known as *balanced trees*. Further
information on this form of tree can be found in *Data Structures and
Algorithms*, by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman (see the Bibliography).

**7.7.3.2 Page Tree Nodes**

Table 29 shows the entries in a page tree node that shall always be
present (Required).

> **Table 29 -- Required entries in a page tree node**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**      **Type**     **Value**
  ------------ ------------ ------------------------------------------
  **Type**     name         *(Required)* The type of PDF object that
                            this dictionary describes; shall be
                            **Pages** for a page tree node.

  **Parent**   dictionary   *(Required except in root node; prohibited
                            in the root node; shall be an indirect
                            reference)* The page tree node that is the
                            immediate parent of this one.

  **Kids**     array        *(Required)* An array of indirect
                            references to the immediate children of
                            this node. The children shall only be page
                            objects or other page tree nodes.

  **Count**    integer      *(Required)* The number of leaf nodes
                            (page objects) that are descendants of
                            this node within the page tree.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE The structure of the page tree is not necessarily related to the
logical structure of the document; that is, page tree nodes do not
represent chapters, sections, and so forth. Other data structures are
defined for this purpose; see 14.7, \"Logical Structure\".

Conforming products shall not be required to preserve the existing
structure of the page tree.

EXAMPLE The following illustrates the page tree for a document with
three pages. See 7.7.3.3, \"Page Objects,\" for the contents of the
individual page objects, and H.5, \"Page Tree Example\", for a more
extended example showing the page tree for a longer document.

> 2 0 obj
>
> \<\< /Type /Pages

/Kids \[ 4 0 R

> 10 0 R
>
> 24 0 R
>
> \]
>
> /Count 3
>
> \>\> endobj
>
> 4 0 obj
>
> \<\< /Type /Page
>
> ... *Additional entries describing the attributes of this page* ...
>
> \>\> endobj
>
> 10 0 obj
>
> \<\< /Type /Page
>
> ... *Additional entries describing the attributes of this page* ...
>
> \>\> endobj
>
> 24 0 obj
>
> \<\< /Type /Page
>
> ... *Additional entries describing the attributes of this page* ...
>
> \>\> endobj

In addition to the entries shown in Table 29, a page tree node may
contain further entries defining *inherited attributes* for the page
objects that are its descendants (see 7.7.3.4, \"Inheritance of Page
Attributes\").

**7.7.3.3 Page Objects**

The leaves of the page tree are *page objects*, each of which is a
dictionary specifying the attributes of a single page of the document.
Table 30 shows the contents of this dictionary. The table also
identifies which attributes a page may inherit from its ancestor nodes
in the page tree, as described under 7.7.3.4, \"Inheritance of Page
Attributes.\" Attributes that are not explicitly identified in the table
as inheritable shall not be inherited.

                                  that this dictionary describes; shall
                                  be **Page** for a page object.

  **Parent**         dictionary   *(Required; shall be an indirect
                                  reference)* The page tree node that is
                                  the immediate parent of this page
                                  object.

  **LastModified**   date         *(Required if **PieceInfo** is

                                  The date and time (see 7.9.4,
                                  \"Dates\") when the page's contents
                                  were most recently modified. If a
                                  page-piece dictionary (**PieceInfo**)
                                  is present, the modification date
                                  shall be used to ascertain which of
                                  the application data dictionaries that
                                  it contains correspond to the current
                                  content of the page (see 14.5,
                                  \"Page-Piece Dictionaries\").

  **Resources**      dictionary   *(Required; inheritable)* A dictionary
                                  containing any resources required by
                                  the page (see 7.8.3, \"Resource
                                  Dictionaries\"). If the page requires
                                  no resources, the value of this entry
                                  shall be an empty dictionary. Omitting
                                  the entry entirely indicates that the
                                  resources shall be inherited from an
                                  ancestor node in the page tree.

  **MediaBox**       rectangle    *(Required; inheritable)* A rectangle
                                  (see 7.9.5, \"Rectangles\"), expressed
                                  in default user space units, that
                                  shall define the boundaries of the
                                  physical medium on which the page
                                  shall be displayed or printed (see
                                  14.11.2, \"Page Boundaries\").

  **CropBox**        rectangle    *(Optional; inheritable)* A rectangle,
                                  expressed in default user space units,
                                  that shall define the visible region
                                  of default user space. When the page
                                  is displayed or printed, its contents
                                  shall be clipped (cropped) to this
                                  rectangle and then shall be imposed on

EXAMPLE The following shows the definition of a page object with a
thumbnail image and two annotations. The media box specifies that the
page is to be printed on letter-size paper. In addition, the resource
dictionary is specified as a direct object and shows that the page makes
use of three fonts named F3, F5, and F7.

**7.7.3.4 Inheritance of Page Attributes**

Some of the page attributes shown in Table 30 are designated as
*inheritable*. If such an attribute is omitted from a page object, its
value shall be inherited from an ancestor node in the page tree. If the
attribute is a required one, a value shall be supplied in an ancestor
node. If the attribute is optional and no inherited value is specified,
the default value shall be used.

An attribute can thus be defined once for a whole set of pages by
specifying it in an intermediate page tree node and arranging the pages
that share the attribute as descendants of that node.

EXAMPLE A document may specify the same media box for all of its pages
by including a **MediaBox** entry in the root node of the page tree. If
necessary, an individual page object may override this inherited value
with a **MediaBox** entry of its own.

In a document conforming to the Linearized PDF organization (see Annex
F), all page attributes shall be specified explicitly as entries in the
page dictionaries to which they apply; they shall not be inherited from
an ancestor node.

Figure 6 illustrates the inheritance of attributes. In the page tree
shown, pages 1, 2, and 4 are rotated clockwise by 90 degrees, page 3 by
270 degrees, page 6 by 180 degrees, and pages 5 and 7 not at all (0
degrees).

**7.7.4 Name Dictionary**

Some categories of objects in a PDF file can be referred to by name
rather than by object reference. The correspondence between names and
objects is established by the document's *name dictionary (PDF 1.2)*,
located by means of the **Names** entry in the document's catalog (see
7.7.2, \"Document Catalog\"). Each entry in this dictionary designates
the root of a name tree (see 7.9.6, \"Name Trees\") defining names for a
particular category of objects. Table 31 shows the contents of the name
dictionary.

###  7.8 Content Streams and Resources

**7.8.1 General**

Content streams are the primary means for describing the appearance of
pages and other graphical elements. A content stream depends on
information contained in an associated resource dictionary; in
combination, these two objects form a self-contained entity. This
sub-clause describes these objects.

**7.8.2 Content Streams**

A *content stream* is a PDF stream object whose data consists of a
sequence of instructions describing the graphical elements to be painted
on a page. The instructions shall be represented in the form of PDF
objects, using the same object syntax as in the rest of the PDF
document. However, whereas the document as a whole is a static,
random-access data structure, the objects in the content stream shall be
interpreted and acted upon sequentially.

Each page of a document shall be represented by one or more content
streams. Content streams shall also be used to package sequences of
instructions as self-contained graphical elements, such as forms (see
8.10, \"Form XObjects\"), patterns (8.7, \"Patterns\"), certain fonts
(9.6.5, \"Type 3 Fonts\"), and annotation appearances (12.5.5,
\"Appearance Streams\").

A content stream, after decoding with any specified filters, shall be
interpreted according to the PDF syntax rules described in 7.2,
\"Lexical Conventions.\" It consists of PDF objects denoting operands
and operators. The operands needed by an operator shall precede it in
the stream. See EXAMPLE 4 in 7.4, \"Filters,\" for an example of a
content stream.

An *operand* is a direct object belonging to any of the basic PDF data
types except a stream. Dictionaries shall be permitted as operands only
by certain specific operators. Indirect objects and object references
shall not be permitted at all.

An *operator* is a PDF keyword specifying some action that shall be
performed, such as painting a graphical shape on the page. An operator
keyword shall be distinguished from a name object by the absence of an
initial SOLIDUS character (2Fh) (/ ). Operators shall be meaningful only
inside a content stream.

NOTE 1 This postfix notation, in which an operator is preceded by its
operands, is superficially the same as in the PostScript language.
However, PDF has no concept of an operand stack as PostScript has.

In PDF, all of the operands needed by an operator shall immediately
precede that operator. Operators do not return results, and operands
shall not be left over when an operator finishes execution.

NOTE 2 Most operators have to do with painting graphical elements on the
page or with specifying parameters that affect subsequent painting
operations. The individual operators are described in the clauses
devoted to their functions:

> Clause 8, \"Graphics\" describes operators that paint general
> graphics, such as filled areas, strokes, and sampled images, and that
> specify device-independent graphical parameters, such as colour.
>
> Clause 9, \"Text\" describes operators that paint text using character
> glyphs defined in fonts.
>
> Clause 10, \"Rendering\" describes operators that specify
> device-dependent rendering parameters.
>
> Clause 14, \"Document Interchange\" describes the marked-content
> operators that associate higher-level logical information with objects
> in the content stream. These operators do not affect the rendered
> appearance of the content; they specify information useful to
> applications that use PDF for document interchange.

Ordinarily, when a conforming reader encounters an operator in a content
stream that it does not recognize, an error shall occur. A pair of
compatibility operators, **BX** and **EX** *(PDF 1.1)*, shall modify
this behaviour (see Table 32). These operators shall occur in pairs and
may be nested. They bracket a *compatibility section*, a portion of a
content stream within which unrecognized operators shall be ignored
without error. This mechanism enables a conforming writer to use
operators defined in later versions of PDF without sacrificing
compatibility with older applications. It should be used only in cases
where ignoring such newer operators is the appropriate thing to do. The
**BX** and **EX** operators are not themselves part of any graphics
object (see 8.2, \"Graphics Objects\") or of the graphics state (8.4,
\"Graphics State\").

> **Table 32 -- Compatibility operators**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Operands**   **Operator**   **Description**
  -------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------
  ---            **BX**         *(PDF 1.1)* Begin a compatibility section.
                                Unrecognized operators (along with their
                                operands) shall be ignored without error
                                until the balancing **EX** operator is
                                encountered.

  ---            **EX**         *(PDF 1.1)* End a compatibility section
                                begun by a balancing **BX** operator.
                                Ignore any unrecognized operands and
                                operators from previous matching **BX**
                                onward.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**7.8.3 Resource Dictionaries**

As stated above, the operands supplied to operators in a content stream
shall only be direct objects; indirect objects and object references
shall not be permitted. In some cases, an operator shall refer to a PDF
object that is defined outside the content stream, such as a font
dictionary or a stream containing image data. This shall be accomplished
by defining such objects as *named resources* and referring to them by
name from within the content stream.

Named resources shall be meaningful only in the context of a content
stream. The scope of a resource name shall be local to a particular
content stream and shall be unrelated to externally known identifiers
for objects such as fonts. References from one object outside of content
streams to another outside of content streams shall be made by means of
indirect object references rather than named resources.

A content stream's named resources shall be defined by a *resource
dictionary*, which shall enumerate the named resources needed by the
operators in the content stream and the names by which they can be
referred to.

EXAMPLE 1 If a text operator appearing within the content stream needs a
certain font, the content stream's resource dictionary can associate the
name F42 with the corresponding font dictionary. The text operator can
use this name to refer to the font.

A resource dictionary shall be associated with a content stream in one
of the following ways:

- For a content stream that is the value of a page's **Contents** entry
  (or is an element of an array that is the value of that entry), the
  resource dictionary shall be designated by the page dictionary's
  **Resources** or is inherited, as described under 7.7.3.4,
  \"Inheritance of Page Attributes,\" from some ancestor node of the
  page object.

- For other content streams, a conforming writer shall include a
  **Resources** entry in the stream\'s dictionary specifying the
  resource dictionary which contains all the resources used by that
  content stream. This shall apply to content streams that define form
  XObjects, patterns, Type 3 fonts, and annotation.

- PDF files written obeying earlier versions of PDF may have omitted the
  **Resources** entry in all form XObjects and Type 3 fonts used on a
  page. All resources that are referenced from those forms and fonts
  shall be inherited from the resource dictionary of the page on which
  they are used. This construct is obsolete and should not be used by
  conforming writers.

In the context of a given content stream, the term *current resource
dictionary* refers to the resource dictionary associated with the stream
in one of the ways described above.

Each key in a resource dictionary shall be the name of a resource type,
as shown in Table 33. The corresponding values shall be as follows:

- For resource type **ProcSet**, the value shall be an array of
  procedure set names

- For all other resource types, the value shall be a subdictionary. Each
  key in the subdictionary shall be the name of a specific resource, and
  the corresponding value shall be a PDF object associated with the
  name.

### 7.9 Common Data Structures

**7.9.1 General**

As mentioned at the beginning of this clause, there are some
general-purpose data structures that are built from the basic object
types described in 7.3, \"Objects,\" and are used in many places
throughout PDF. This subclause describes data structures for text
strings, dates, rectangles, name trees, and number trees. More complex
data structures are described in 7.10, \"Functions,\" and 7.11, \"File
Specifications.\"

All of these data structures are meaningful only as part of the document
hierarchy; they may not appear within content streams. In particular,
the special conventions for interpreting the values of string objects
apply only to strings outside content streams. An entirely different
convention is used within content streams for using strings to select
sequences of glyphs to be painted on the page (see clause 9, \"Text\").
Table 34 summarizes the basic and higher-level data types that are used
throughout this standard to describe the values of dictionary entries
and other PDF data values.

**7.9.2 String Object Types**

**7.9.2.1 General**

PDF supports one fundamental string object (see 7.3.4, \"String
Objects\"). The string object shall be further qualified as a text
string, a PDFDocEncoded string, ASCII string, or byte string. The
further qualification reflects the encoding used to represent the
characters or glyphs described by the string.

Table 35 summarizes the string object types that represent data encoded
using specific conventions.

| text string     | Shall be used for              |
|                 | human-readable text, such as   |
|                 | text annotations, bookmark     |
|                 | names, article names, and      |
|                 | document information. These    |
|                 | strings shall be encoded using |
|                 | either PDFDocEncoding or       |
|                 | UTF-16BE with a leading        |

|                 | single byte using ASCII        |
|                 | encoding.                      |
+-----------------+--------------------------------+
| byte string     | Shall be used for binary data  |
|                 | represented as a series of     |
|                 | bytes, where each byte can be  |
|                 | any value representable in 8   |
|                 | bits. The string may represent |
|                 | characters but the encoding is |
|                 | not known. The bytes of the    |
|                 | string need not represent      |
|                 | characters. This type shall be |
|                 | used for data such as MD5 hash |
|                 | values, signature              |
|                 | certificates, and Web Capture  |
|                 | identification values.         |

+-----------------+--------------------------------+

The string types described in Table 35 specify increasingly specific
encoding schemes, as shown in Figure 7.

> **Figure 7 -- Relationship between string types**

**7.9.2.2 Text String Type**

The text string type shall be used for character strings that contain
information intended to be human-readable, such as text annotations,
bookmark names, article names, document information, and so forth.

NOTE 1 Text string type is a subtype of string type and represents data
encoded using specific conventions.

The text string type shall be used for character strings that shall be
encoded in either **PDFDocEncoding** or the UTF-16BE Unicode character
encoding scheme. **PDFDocEncoding** can encode all of the ISO Latin 1
character set and is documented in Annex D. UTF-16BE can encode all
Unicode characters. UTF-16BE and Unicode character encoding are
described in the *Unicode Standard* by the Unicode Consortium (see the
Bibliography).

NOTE 2 **PDFDocEncoding** does not support all Unicode characters
whereas UTF-16BE does.

For text strings encoded in Unicode, the first two bytes shall be 254
followed by 255. These two bytes represent the Unicode byte order
marker, U+FEFF, indicating that the string is encoded in the UTF-16BE
(big-endian) encoding scheme specified in the Unicode standard.

NOTE 3 This mechanism precludes beginning a string using
**PDFDocEncoding** with the two characters thorn ydieresis, which is
unlikely to be a meaningful beginning of a word or phrase.

Conforming readers that process PDF files containing Unicode text
strings shall be prepared to handle supplementary characters; that is,
characters requiring more than two bytes to represent.

An escape sequence may appear anywhere in a Unicode text string to
indicate the language in which subsequent text shall be written.

NOTE 4 This is useful when the language cannot be determined from the
character codes used in the text.

The escape sequence shall consist of the following elements, in order:

a)  The Unicode value U+001B (that is, the byte sequence 0 followed by
    27).

b)  A 2- byte ISO 639 language code.

EXAMPLE en for English or ja for Japanese encoded as ASCII characters.

c)  *(Optional)* A 2-byte ISO 3166 country code.

EXAMPLE US for the United States or JP for Japan.

d)  The Unicode value U+001B.

NOTE 5 The complete list of codes defined by ISO 639 and ISO 3166 can be
obtained from the International Organization for Standardization (see
the Bibliography).

**7.9.2.3 PDFDocEncoded String Type**

A PDFDocEncoded string is a character string in which the characters
shall be represented in a single byte using PDFDocEncoding.

NOTE **PDFDocEncoding** does not support all Unicode characters whereas
UTF-16BE does.

**7.9.2.4 Byte String Type**

The byte string type shall be used for binary data that shall be
represented as a series of bytes, where each byte may be any value
representable in 8 bits. Byte string type is a subtype of string type.

NOTE The string may represent characters but the encoding is not known.
The bytes of the string may not represent characters.

**7.9.3 Text Streams**

A *text stream (PDF 1.5)* shall be a PDF stream object (7.3.8, \"Stream
Objects\") whose unencoded bytes shall meet the same requirements as a
text string (7.9.2.2, \"Text String Type\") with respect to encoding,
byte order, and lead bytes.

**7.9.4 Dates**

Date values used in a PDF shall conform to a standard date format, which
closely follows that of the international standard ASN.1 (Abstract
Syntax Notation One), defined in ISO/IEC 8824. A date shall be a text
string of the form

( D : *YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH* \' *mm* ) where:

> *YYYY* shall be the year
>
> *MM* shall be the month (01--12)
>
> *DD* shall be the day (01--31)
>
> *HH* shall be the hour (00--23)
>
> *mm* shall be the minute (00--59)
>
> *SS* shall be the second (00--59)
>
> *O* shall be the relationship of local time to Universal Time (UT),
> and shall be denoted by one of the characters PLUS SIGN (U+002B) (+),
> HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D) (-), or LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z (U+005A) (Z) (see
> below)
>
> *HH* followed by APOSTROPHE (U+0027) (\') shall be the absolute value
> of the offset from UT in hours
>
> (00--23) *mm* shall be the absolute value of the offset from UT in
> minutes (00--59)

The prefix D: shall be present, the year field (YYYY) shall be present
and all other fields may be present but only if all of their preceding
fields are also present. The APOSTROPHE following the hour offset field
(HH) shall only be present if the HH field is present. The minute offset
field (mm) shall only be present if the APOSTROPHE following the hour
offset field (HH) is present. The default values for *MM* and *DD* shall
be both 01; all other numerical fields shall default to zero values. A
PLUS SIGN as the value of the *O* field signifies that local time is
later than UT, a HYPHEN-MINUS signifies that local time is earlier than
UT, and the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z signifies that local time is equal to
UT. If no UT information is specified, the relationship of the specified
time to UT shall be considered to be GMT. Regardless of whether the time
zone is specified, the rest of the date shall be specified in local
time.

EXAMPLE For example, December 23, 1998, at 7:52 PM, U.S. Pacific
Standard Time, is represented by the string

> D : 199812231952 - 08 \' 00

**7.9.5 Rectangles**

Rectangles are used to describe locations on a page and bounding boxes
for a variety of objects. A rectangle shall be written as an array of
four numbers giving the coordinates of a pair of diagonally opposite
corners.

NOTE Although rectangles are conventionally specified by their
lower-left and upper-right corners, it is acceptable to specify any two
diagonally opposite corners. Applications that process PDF should be
prepared to normalize such rectangles in situations where specific
corners are required.

> Typically, the array takes the form
>
> \[ *ll~x~ ll~y~ ur~x~ ur~y~* \]
>
> specifying the lower-left *x*, lower-left *y*, upper-right *x*, and
> upper-right *y* coordinates of the rectangle, in that order. The other
> two corners of the rectangle are then assumed to have coordinates
> (*ll~x~*, *ur~y~*) and (*ur~x~*, *ll~y~*).

**7.9.6 Name Trees**

A *name tree* serves a similar purpose to a dictionary---associating
keys and values---but by different means. A name tree differs from a
dictionary in the following important ways:

- Unlike the keys in a dictionary, which are name objects, those in a
  name tree are strings.

- The keys are ordered.

- The values associated with the keys may be objects of any type. Stream
  objects shall be specified by indirect object references (7.3.8,
  \"Stream Objects\"). The dictionary, array, and string objects should
  be specified by indirect object references, and other PDF objects
  (nulls, numbers, booleans, and names) should be specified as direct
  objects.

- The data structure can represent an arbitrarily large collection of
  key-value pairs, which can be looked up efficiently without requiring
  the entire data structure to be read from the PDF file. (In contrast,
  a dictionary can be subject to an implementation limit on the number
  of entries it can contain.)

A name tree shall be constructed of *nodes*, each of which shall be a
dictionary object. Table 36 shows the entries in a node dictionary. The
nodes shall be of three kinds, depending on the specific entries they
contain. The tree shall always have exactly one *root node*, which shall
contain a single entry: either **Kids** or **Names** but not both. If
the root node has a **Names** entry, it shall be the only node in the
tree. If it has a **Kids** entry, each of the remaining nodes shall be
either an *intermediate node*, that shall contain a **Limits** entry and
a **Kids** entry, or a *leaf node*, that shall contain a **Limits**
entry and a **Names** entry.

| **Kids**   | array    | *(Root and intermediate nodes only;         |
|            |          | required in intermediate nodes; present in  |

|            |          | not present)* Shall be an array of indirect |
|            |          | references to the immediate children of     |
|            |          | this node. The children may be intermediate |
|            |          | or leaf nodes.                              |

|            |          | only if* **Kids** *is not present)* Shall   |
|            |          | be an array of the form                     |
|            |          |                                             |
|            |          | \[ *key*~1~ *value*~1~ *key*~2~ *value*~2~  |
|            |          | ... *key~n~* *value~n~*\] where each        |
|            |          | *key*~i~ shall be a string and the          |
|            |          | corresponding *value*~i~ shall be the       |
|            |          | object associated with that key. The keys   |
|            |          | shall be sorted in lexical order, as        |
|            |          | described below.                            |
+------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| **Limits** | array    | *(Intermediate and leaf nodes only;         |
|            |          | required)* Shall be an array of two         |
|            |          | strings, that shall specify the (lexically) |
|            |          | least and greatest keys included in the     |
|            |          | **Names** array of a leaf node or in the    |
|            |          | **Names** arrays of any leaf nodes that are |
|            |          | descendants of an intermediate node.        |
+------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

The **Kids** entries in the root and intermediate nodes define the
tree's structure by identifying the immediate children of each node. The
**Names** entries in the leaf (or root) nodes shall contain the tree's
keys and their associated values, arranged in key-value pairs and shall
be sorted lexically in ascending order by key. Shorter keys shall appear
before longer ones beginning with the same byte sequence. Any encoding
of the keys may be used as long as it is self-consistent; keys shall be
compared for equality on a simple byte-by-byte basis.

The keys contained within the various nodes' **Names** entries shall not
overlap; each **Names** entry shall contain a single contiguous range of
all the keys in the tree. In a leaf node, the **Limits** entry shall
specify the least and greatest keys contained within the node's
**Names** entry. In an intermediate node, it shall specify the least and
greatest keys contained within the **Names** entries of any of that
node's descendants. The value associated with a given key can thus be
found by walking the tree in order, searching for the leaf node whose
**Names** entry contains that key.

numbers and nodes, of a name tree that maps the names of all the
chemical elements, from actinium to zirconium, to their atomic numbers.

A *number tree* is similar to a name tree (see 7.9.6, \"Name Trees\"),
except that its keys shall be integers instead of strings and shall be
sorted in ascending numerical order. The entries in the leaf (or root)
nodes containing the key-value pairs shall be named **Nums** instead of
**Names** as in a name tree. Table 37 shows the entries in a number
tree's node dictionaries.

### 7.10 Functions

**7.10.1 General**

PDF is not a programming language, and a PDF file is not a program.
However, PDF provides several types of *function objects (PDF 1.2)* that
represent parameterized classes of functions, including mathematical
formulas and sampled representations with arbitrary resolution.

NOTE 1 Functions may be used in various ways in PDF, including
device-dependent rasterization information for highquality printing
(halftone spot functions and transfer functions), colour transform
functions for certain colour spaces, and specification of colours as a
function of position for smooth shadings.

Functions in PDF represent static, self-contained numerical
transformations.

NOTE 2 A function to add two numbers has two input values and one output
value:

> *f x*( 0, *x*1) = *x*0 + *x*1
>
> Similarly, a function that computes the arithmetic and geometric mean
> of two numbers can be viewed as a function of two input values and two
> output values:

*f x*( ~0~, *x*~1~) = \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--*x*^0\ +^~2~ ^*x*1^-,
*x*~0~ × *x*~1~

In general, a function can take any number *(m)* of input values and
produce any number *(n)* of output values:

> *f x*( 0, ..., *xm* -- 1) = *y*0, ..., *yn* -- 1

In PDF functions, all the input values and all the output values shall
be numbers, and functions shall have no side effects.

Each function definition includes a *domain*, the set of legal values
for the input. Some types of functions also define a *range*, the set of
legal values for the output. Input values passed to the function shall
be clipped to the domain, and output values produced by the function
shall be clipped to the range.

EXAMPLE Suppose the following function is defined with a domain of \[-1
1 \]. If the function is called with the input value 6, that value is
replaced with the nearest value in the defined domain, 1, before the
function is evaluated; the resulting output value is therefore 3. *f x*(
) = *x* + 2

> Similarly, if the following function is defined with a range of \[ 0
> 100 \], and if the input values -6 and 4 are passed to the function
> (and are within its domain), then the output value produced by the
> function, -14, is replaced with 0, the nearest value in the defined
> range.
>
> *f x*( 0, *x*1) = 3 × *x*0 + *x*1

A function object may be a dictionary or a stream, depending on the type
of function. The term *function dictionary* is used generically in this
sub-clause to refer to either a dictionary object or the dictionary
portion of a stream object. A function dictionary specifies the
function's representation, the set of attributes that parameterize that
representation, and the additional data needed by that representation.
Four types of functions are available, as indicated by the dictionary's
**FunctionType** entry:

- *(PDF 1.2)* A *sampled function* (type 0) uses a table of *sample
  values* to define the function. Various techniques are used to
  interpolate values between the sample values; see 7.10.2, \"Type 0
  (Sampled)

> Functions.\"

- *(PDF 1.3)* An *exponential interpolation function* (type 2) defines a
  set of coefficients for an exponential function; see 7.10.3, \"Type 2
  (Exponential Interpolation) Functions.\"

- *(PDF 1.3)* A *stitching function* (type 3) is a combination of other
  functions, partitioned across a domain; see 7.10.4, \"Type 3
  (Stitching) Functions.\"

- *(PDF 1.3)* A *PostScript calculator function* (type 4) uses operators
  from the PostScript language to describe an arithmetic expression; see
  7.10.5, \"Type 4 (PostScript Calculator) Functions.\"

All function dictionaries shall share the entries listed in Table 38.

|                  |          | input value, *x~i~* , shall lie in    |
|                  |          | the interval **Domain**~2~*i* ≤       |
|                  |          | *x~i~* ≤ **Domain**~2~*i*~+~1 . Input |
|                  |          | values outside the declared domain    |

|                  |          | below)* An array of 2 × *n* numbers,  |
|                  |          | where *n* shall be the number of      |
|                  |          | output values. For each *j* from 0 to |
|                  |          | *n* − 1, **Range**~2*j*~ shall be     |
|                  |          | less than or equal to                 |
|                  |          | **Range**~2*j*+1~ , and the *j*th     |
|                  |          | output value, *y~j~* , shall lie in   |
|                  |          | the interval **Range**~2~*j* ≤ *y~j~* |
|                  |          | ≤ **Range**~2~*j*+1. Output values    |
|                  |          | outside the declared range shall be   |
|                  |          | clipped to the nearest boundary       |
|                  |          | value. If this entry is absent, no    |
|                  |          | clipping shall be done.               |
+------------------+----------+---------------------------------------+

In addition, each type of function dictionary shall include entries
appropriate to the particular function type. The number of output values
can usually be inferred from other attributes of the function; if not
(as is always the case for type 0 and type 4 functions), the **Range**
entry is required. The dimensionality of the function implied by the
**Domain** and **Range** entries shall be consistent with that implied
by other attributes of the function.

**7.10.2 Type 0 (Sampled) Functions**

Type 0 functions use a sequence of *sample values* (contained in a
stream) to provide an approximation for functions whose domains and
ranges are bounded. The samples are organized as an *m*-dimensional
table in which each entry has *n* components.

NOTE 1 Sampled functions are highly general and offer reasonably
accurate representations of arbitrary analytic functions at low expense.
For example, a 1-input sinusoidal function can be represented over the
range \[ 0 180 \] with an average error of only 1 percent, using just
ten samples and linear interpolation. Two-input functions require
significantly more samples but usually not a prohibitive number if the
function does not have high frequency variations.

There shall be no dimensionality limit of a sampled function except for
possible implementation limits.

NOTE 2 The number of samples required to represent functions with high
dimensionality multiplies rapidly unless the sampling resolution is very
low. Also, the process of multilinear interpolation becomes
computationally intensive if the number of inputs *m* is greater than 2.
The multidimensional spline interpolation is even more computationally
intensive.

In addition to the entries in Table 38, a type 0 function dictionary
includes those shown in Table 39.

The **Domain**, **Encode**, and **Size** entries determine how the
function's input variable values are mapped into the sample table. For
example, if **Size** is \[ 21 31 \], the default **Encode** array shall
be \[ 0 20 0 30 \], which maps the entire domain into the full set of
sample table entries. Other values of **Encode** may be used.

To explain the relationship between **Domain**, **Encode**, **Size**,
**Decode**, and **Range**, we use the following notation:

> *y* = Interpolate(*x x*, min, *x*max, *y*min, *y*max)

⎛ *y*max -- *y*min- ⎞⎟

> = ymin + ⎜⎝(*x* -- *x*min) ×
> \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--*x*max -- *x*min ⎠

For a given value of *x*, Interpolate calculates the *y* value on the
line defined by the two points (*x*~min~ , *y*~min~ ) and (*x*max ,
*y*max).

                                  \[ 0 (**Size**0 − 1) 0 (**Size**1 − 1)
                                  ... \].

  **Decode**          array       *(Optional)* An array of 2 × *n*
                                  numbers specifying the linear mapping
                                  of sample values into the range
                                  appropriate for the function's output
                                  values. Default value: same as the
                                  value of **Range**.

  *other stream       (various)   *(Optional)* Other attributes of the
  attributes*                     stream that shall provide the sample
                                  values, as appropriate (see Table 5).
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

When a sampled function is called, each input value *x~i~* , for 0 £ *i*
\< *m*, shall be clipped to the domain:

*xi*′ = min max( (*xi*, Domain2*i* ), Domain2*i* + 1)

That value shall be encoded:

> *ei* = Interpolate(*xi*′, Domain2*i*, Domain2*i* + 1, Encode2*i*,
> Encode2*i* + 1)

That value shall be clipped to the size of the sample table in that
dimension:

*e~i~*′ = min max( (*e~i~*, 0), ^Size^*~i~* -- 1)

The encoded input values shall be real numbers, not restricted to
integers. Interpolation shall be used to determine output values from
the nearest surrounding values in the sample table. Each output value
*r~j~* , for 0 £ *j* \< *n*, shall then be decoded:

*rj*′ = Interpolate(*rj*, 0 2, BitsPerSample -- 1, Decode2*j*,
Decode2*j* + 1)

Finally, each decoded value shall be clipped to the range:

*yj* = min max( (*rj*′, Range2*j* ), Range2*j* + 1)

Sample data shall be represented as a stream of bytes. The bytes shall
constitute a continuous bit stream, with the high-order bit of each byte
first. Each sample value shall be represented as a sequence of
**BitsPerSample** bits. Successive values shall be adjacent in the bit
stream; there shall be no padding at byte boundaries.

For a function with multidimensional input (more than one input
variable), the sample values in the first dimension vary fastest, and
the values in the last dimension vary slowest.

> EXAMPLE 1 For a function *f* (*a*, *b*, *c*), where *a*, *b*, and *c*
> vary from 0 to 9 in steps of 1, the sample values would appear in this
> order: *f* (0, 0, 0), *f* (1, 0, 0), ... , *f* (9, 0, 0), *f* (0, 1,
> 0), *f* (1, 1, 0), ... , *f* (9, 1, 0), *f* (0, 2, 0), *f* (1, 2, 0),
> ... , *f* (9, 9, 0), *f* (0, 0, 1), *f* (1, 0, 1), and so on.

For a function with multidimensional output (more than one output
value), the values shall be stored in the same order as **Range**.

The stream data shall be long enough to contain the entire sample array,
as indicated by **Size**, **Range**, and **BitsPerSample**; see 7.3.8.2,
\"Stream Extent.\"

Example 2 illustrates a sampled function with 4-bit samples in an array
containing 21 columns and 31 rows (651 values). The function takes two
arguments, *x* and *y*, in the domain \[-1.0 1.0 \], and returns one
value, *z*, in that same range. The *x* argument shall be linearly
transformed by the encoding to the domain \[ 0 20 \] and the *y*
argument to the domain \[ 0 30 \]. Using bilinear interpolation between
sample points, the function computes a value for *z*, which (because
**BitsPerSample** is 4) will be in the range \[ 0 15 \], and the
decoding transforms *z* to a number in the range \[ -1.0 1.0 \] for the
result. The sample array shall be stored in a string of 326 bytes,
calculated as follows (rounded up):

> 326 bytes = 31 rows ¥ 21 samples / row ¥ 4 bits / sample ³ 8 bits /
> byte

The first byte contains the sample for the point (-1.0, -1.0) in the
high-order 4 bits and the sample for the point (-0.9, -1.0) in the
low-order 4 bits.

NOTE 3 The **Decode** entry can be used creatively to increase the
accuracy of encoded samples corresponding to certain values in the
range.

EXAMPLE 3 If the range of the function is \[ -1.0 1.0 \] and
**BitsPerSample** is 4, the usual value of **Decode** would be \[ -1.0
1.0 \] and the sample values would be integers in the interval \[ 0 15
\] (as shown in Figure 8). But if these values are used, the midpoint of
the range, 0.0, is not represented exactly by any sample value, since it
falls halfway between 7 and 8. However, if the **Decode** array is \[
-1.0 +1.1429 \] (1.1429 being

> approximately equal to 16 ³ 14) and the sample values supplied are in
> the interval \[ 0 14 \], the effective range of \[ -1.0 1.0 \] is
> achieved, and the range value 0.0 is represented by the sample value
> 7.

The **Size** value for an input dimension can be 1, in which case all
input values in that dimension shall be mapped to the single allowed
value. If **Size** is less than 4, cubic spline interpolation is not
possible and **Order** 3 shall be ignored if specified.

**7.10.3 Type 2 (Exponential Interpolation) Functions**

Type 2 functions *(PDF 1.3)* include a set of parameters that define an
*exponential interpolation* of one input value and *n* output values:

> *f x*( ) = *y*0, ..., *yn* -- 1

In addition to the entries in Table 38, a type 2 function dictionary
shall include those listed in Table 40.

> **Table 40 -- Additional entries specific to a type 2 function
> dictionary**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**   **Value**
  --------- ---------- ----------------------------------------------
  **C0**    array      *(Optional)* An array of *n* numbers that
                       shall define the function result when *x* =
                       0.0. Default value: \[ 0.0 \].

  **C1**    array      *(Optional)* An array of *n* numbers that
                       shall define the function result when *x* =
                       1.0. Default value: \[ 1.0 \].

  **N**     number     *(Required)* The interpolation exponent. Each
                       input value *x* shall return *n* values, given
                       by *y~j~* = **C0***~j~* + *x*^N^ ×
                       (**C1***~j~* − **C0***~j~* ), for 0 ≤ *j* \<
                       *n*.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

Values of **Domain** shall constrain *x* in such a way that if **N** is
not an integer, all values of *x* shall be nonnegative, and if **N** is
negative, no value of *x* shall be zero. Typically, **Domain** is
declared as \[ 0.0 1.0 \], and **N** is a positive number. To clip the
output to a specified range The **Range** attribute shall be used.

NOTE When **N** is 1, the function performs a linear interpolation
between **C0** and **C1**; therefore, the function can also be expressed
as a sampled function (type 0).

**7.10.4 Type 3 (Stitching) Functions**

Type 3 functions *(PDF 1.3)* define a *stitching* of the subdomains of
several 1-input functions to produce a single new 1-input function.
Since the resulting stitching function is a 1-input function, the domain
is given by a twoelement array, \[ **Domain**~0~ **Domain**~1~ \].

In addition to the entries in Table 38, a type 3 function dictionary
shall include those listed in Table 41.

> **Table 41 -- Additional entries specific to a type 3 function
> dictionary**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**         **Type**   **Value**
  --------------- ---------- --------------------------------------------
  **Functions**   array      *(Required)* An array of *k* 1-input
                             functions that shall make up the stitching
                             function. The output dimensionality of all
                             functions shall be the same, and compatible
                             with the value of **Range** if **Range** is
                             present.

  **Bounds**      array      *(Required)* An array of *k* − 1 numbers
                             that, in combination with **Domain**, shall
                             define the intervals to which each function
                             from the **Functions** array shall apply.
                             **Bounds** elements shall be in order of
                             increasing value, and each value shall be
                             within the domain defined by **Domain**.

  **Encode**      array      *(Required)* An array of 2 × *k* numbers
                             that, taken in pairs, shall map each subset
                             of the domain defined by **Domain** and the
                             **Bounds** array to the domain of the
                             corresponding function.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Domain** shall be of size 2 (that is, *m* = 1), and **Domain**~0~
shall be strictly less than **Domain**~1~ unless *k* = 1. The domain
shall be partitioned into *k* subdomains, as indicated by the
dictionary's **Bounds** entry, which shall be an array of *k* - 1
numbers that obey the following relationships (with exceptions as noted
below):

> Domain~0~ \< Bounds~0~ \< Bounds~1~ \< ... \< Bounds~*k*\ --\ 2~ \<
> Domain~1~

The **Bounds** array shall describe a series of half-open intervals,
closed on the left and open on the right (except the last, which is
closed on the right as well). The value of the **Functions** entry shall
be an array of *k* functions. The first function shall apply to *x*
values in the first subdomain, **Domain**~0~ £ *x* \< **Bounds**~0~ ;
the second function shall apply to *x* values in the second subdomain,
**Bounds**~0~ £ *x* \< **Bounds**~1~ ; and so on. The last function
shall apply to *x* values in the last subdomain, which includes the
upper bound:

**Bounds**~*k*-2~ £ *x* £ **Domain**~1~ . The value of *k* may be 1, in
which case the **Bounds** array shall be empty and the single item in
the **Functions** array shall apply to all *x* values, **Domain**~0~ £
*x* £ **Domain**~1~ .

The **Encode** array contains 2 ¥ *k* numbers. A value *x* from the
*i*th subdomain shall be encoded as follows:

*x*′ = Interpolate(*x*, Bounds*i* -- 1, Bounds· *i*, Encode2*i*,
Encode2*i* + 1)

for 0 £ *i* \< *k*. In this equation, **Bounds**~-1~ means **Domain**~0~
, and **Bounds**~*k*-1~ means **Domain**~1~ . If the last bound,
**Bounds***~k~*-2, is equal to **Domain**~1~ , then *x* ¢ shall be
defined to be **Encode**~2~*i* .

NOTE The stitching function is designed to make it easy to combine
several functions to be used within one shading pattern over different
parts of the shading's domain. Shading patterns are discussed in 8.7.4,
\"Shading Patterns\". The same effect could be achieved by creating a
separate shading dictionary for each of the functions, with adjacent
domains. However, since each shading would have similar parameters, and
because the overall effect is one shading, it is more convenient to have
a single shading with multiple function definitions. Also, type 3
functions provide a general mechanism for inverting the domains of
1-input functions.

EXAMPLE Consider a function *f* with a **Domain** of \[ 0.0 1.0 \] and a
stitching function *g* with a **Domain** of \[ 0.0 1.0 \], a
**Functions** array containing *f*, and an **Encode** array of \[ 1.0
0.0 \]. In effect, *g* (*x*) = *f* (1 - *x*).

**7.10.5 Type 4 (PostScript Calculator) Functions**

> **7.10.5.1 General**

A type 4 function *(PDF 1.3)*, also called a PostScript calculator
function, shall be represented as a stream containing code written in a
small subset of the PostScript language.

NOTE Although any function can be sampled (in a type 0 PDF function) and
others can be described with exponential functions (type 2 in PDF), type
4 functions offer greater flexibility and potentially greater accuracy.
For example, a tint transformation function for a hexachrome
(six-component) **DeviceN** colour space with an alternate colour space
of **DeviceCMYK** (see 8.6.6.5, \"DeviceN Colour Spaces\") requires a
6-in, 4-out function.

> If such a function were sampled with *m* values for each input
> variable, the number of samples, 4 ¥ *m*^6^, could be prohibitively
> large. In practice, such functions can often be written as short,
> simple PostScript functions.
>
> Type 4 functions also make it possible to include a wide variety of
> halftone spot functions without the loss of accuracy that comes from
> sampling, and without adding to the list of predefined spot functions
> (see 10.5.3, \"Spot Functions\"). All of the predefined spot functions
> can be written as type 4 functions.

The language that shall be used in a type 4 function contains
expressions involving integers, real numbers, and boolean values only.
There shall be no composite data structures such as strings or arrays,
no procedures, and no variables or names. Table 42 lists the operators
that can be used in this type of function. (For more information on
these operators, see Appendix B of the *PostScript Language Reference*,
Third Edition.) Although the semantics are those of the corresponding
PostScript operators, a full PostScript interpreter is not required.

+---------------+----------------+------------+----------+---------+------------+

The operand syntax for type 4 functions shall follow PDF conventions
rather than PostScript conventions. The entire code stream defining the
function shall be enclosed in braces { } (using LEFT CURLY BRACE (7Bh)
and RIGHT CURLY BRACE (07hD)). Braces also shall delimit expressions
that are executed conditionally by the **if** and **ifelse** operators:

- *boolean* { *expression* } if

- *boolean* { *expression*~1~ } { *expression*~2~ } ifelse

This construct is purely syntactic; unlike in PostScript, no "procedure
objects" shall be involved.

A type 4 function dictionary shall include the entries in Table 38, as
well as other appropriate stream attributes (see Table 5). The following
example shows a type 4 function equivalent to the predefined spot
function **DoubleDot** (see 10.5.3, \"Spot Functions\").

EXAMPLE 10 0 obj

\<\< /FunctionType 4

> /Domain \[ -1.0 1.0 -1.0 1.0 \]
>
> /Range \[ -1.0 1.0 \]
>
> /Length 71
>
> \>\> stream { 360 mul sin 2 div
>
> exch 360 mul sin
>
> 2 div add
>
> }
>
> endstream endobj

The **Domain** and **Range** entries shall both be required. The input
variables shall constitute the initial operand stack; the items
remaining on the operand stack after execution of the function shall be
the output variables. It shall be an error for the number of remaining
operands to differ from the number of output variables specified by
**Range** or for any of them to be objects other than numbers.

Implementations of type 4 functions shall provide a stack with room for
at least 100 entries. No implementation shall be required to provide a
larger stack, and it shall be an error to overflow the stack.

Although any integers or real numbers that may appear in the stream fall
under the same implementation limits (defined in Annex C) as in other
contexts, the *intermediate* results in type 4 function computations
shall not. An implementation may use a representation that exceeds those
limits. Operations on real numbers, for example, might use
single-precision or double-precision floating-point numbers.

> **7.10.5.2 Errors in Type 4 Functions**

The part of a conforming reader that reads a type 4 function (analogous
to the PostScript *scanner*) shall detect and report syntax errors. Any
errors detected by the conforming reader shall be errors in the PDF file
and shall be handled like other errors in the file.

The part of a conforming reader that executes a type 4 function
(analogous to the PostScript *interpreter*) shall detect and report
errors. This specification does not define a representation for the
errors; those details shall be provided by the conforming reader that
processes the PDF file. The following types of errors can occur (among
others):

- Stack overflow

- Stack underflow

- A type error (for example, applying **not** to a real number)

- A range error (for example, applying **sqrt** to a negative number)

- An undefined result (for example, dividing by 0)

### 7.11 File Specifications

**7.11.1 General**

A PDF file can refer to the contents of another file by using a *file
specification* *(PDF 1.1)*, which shall take either of two forms:

- A *simple* file specification shall give just the name of the target
  file in a standard format, independent of the naming conventions of
  any particular file system. It shall take the form of either a string
  or a dictionary

- A *full* file specification shall include information related to one
  or more specific file systems. It shall only be represented as a
  dictionary.

A file specification shall refer to a file external to the PDF file or
to a file embedded within the referring PDF file, allowing its contents
to be stored or transmitted along with the PDF file. The file shall be
considered to be external to the PDF file in either case.

**7.11.2 File Specification Strings**

> **7.11.2.1 General**

The standard format for representing a simple file specification in
string form divides the string into component substrings separated by
the SOLIDUS character (2Fh) (/). The SOLIDUS is a generic component
separator that shall be mapped to the appropriate platform-specific
separator when generating a platform-dependent file name. Any of the
components may be empty. If a component contains one or more literal
SOLIDI, each shall be preceded by a REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch) (\\), which in
turn shall be preceded by another REVERSE SOLIDUS to indicate that it is
part of the string and not an escape character.

EXAMPLE ( in \\ \\ /out )

> represents the file name in / out

The REVERSE SOLIDI shall be removed in processing the string; they are
needed only to distinguish the component values from the component
separators. The component substrings shall be stored as bytes and shall
be passed to the operating system without interpretation or conversion
of any sort.

> **7.11.2.2 Absolute and Relative File Specifications**

A simple file specification that begins with a SOLIDUS shall be an
*absolute* file specification. The last component shall be the file
name; the preceding components shall specify its context. In some file
specifications, the file name may be empty; for example, URL (uniform
resource locator) specifications can specify directories instead of
files. A file specification that does not begin with a SOLIDUS shall be
a *relative* file specification giving the location of the file relative
to that of the PDF file containing it.

In the case of a URL-based file system, the rules of Internet RFC 1808,
*Relative Uniform Resource Locators* (see the Bibliography), shall be
used to compute an absolute URL from a relative file specification and
the specification of the PDF file. Prior to this process, the relative
file specification shall be converted to a relative URL by using the
escape mechanism of RFC 1738, *Uniform Resource Locators*, to represent
any bytes that would be either unsafe according to RFC 1738 or not
representable in 7-bit U.S. ASCII. In addition, such URLbased relative
file specifications shall be limited to paths as defined in RFC 1808.
The scheme, network location/login, fragment identifier, query
information, and parameter sections shall not be allowed.

In the case of other file systems, a relative file specification shall
be converted to an absolute file specification by removing the file name
component from the specification of the containing PDF file and
appending the relative file specification in its place.

EXAMPLE 1 The relative file specification

> ArtFiles / Figure1 . pdf
>
> appearing in a PDF file whose specification is
>
> / HardDisk / PDFDocuments / AnnualReport / Summary . pdf
>
> yields the absolute specification
>
> / HardDisk / PDFDocuments / AnnualReport / ArtFiles / Figure1 . pdf

The special component . . (two PERIODs) (2Eh) can be used in a relative
file specification to move up a level in the file system hierarchy.
After an absolute specification has been derived, when the component
immediately preceding . . is not another . . , the two cancel each
other; both are eliminated from the file specification and the process

> **7.11.2.3 Conversion to Platform-Dependent File Names**

The conversion of a file specification to a platform-dependent file name
depends on the specific file naming conventions of each platform:

- For DOS, the initial component shall be either a physical or logical
  drive identifier or a network resource name as returned by the
  Microsoft Windows function WNetGetConnection, and shall be followed by
  a COLON (3Ah) ( : ). A network resource name shall be constructed from
  the first two components; the first component shall be the server name
  and the second shall be the share name (volume name). All components
  shall be separated by REVERSE SOLIDI (backslashes) (5Ch). It shall be
  possible to specify an absolute DOS path without a drive by making the
  first component empty. (Empty components are ignored by other
  platforms.)

- For Mac OS, all components shall be separated by COLONs.

- For UNIX, all components shall be separated by SOLIDI (2Fh) (slashes).
  An initial SOLIDUS, if present, shall be preserved.

Strings used to specify a file name shall be interpreted in the standard
encoding for the platform on which the document is being viewed. Table
43 shows examples of file specifications on the most common platforms.

+------------+---------------------------------+
| NOTE 2     | Some file systems are           |
|            | case-insensitive, and names     |
|            | within a directory are unique   |
|            | so names should remain          |
|            | distinguishable if lowercase    |
|            | letters are changed to          |
|            | uppercase or vice versa. On DOS |
|            | and Windows 3.1 systems and on  |
|            | some CD-ROM file systems, file  |
|            | names are limited to 8          |
|            | characters plus a 3-character   |
|            | extension. File system software |
|            | typically converts long names   |
|            | to short names by retaining the |
|            | first 6 or 7 characters of the  |
|            | file name and the first 3       |
|            | characters after the last       |
|            | PERIOD, if any. Since           |
|            | characters beyond the sixth or  |
|            | seventh are often converted to  |
|            | other values unrelated to the   |
|            | original value, file names      |
|            | should be distinguishable from  |
|            | the first 6 characters.         |
+------------+---------------------------------+

> **7.11.2.4 Multiple-Byte Strings in File Specifications**

In PDF 1.2 or higher, a file specification may contain multiple-byte
character codes, represented in hexadecimal form between angle brackets
(\< and \>) (using LESS-THAN SIGN (3Ch) and GREATER-THAN SIGN (3Eh)).
Since the SOLIDUS (2Fh) (slash character), denoted as \< 2F \>, is used
as a component delimiter and the REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch) (backslash
character), denoted as \< 5C \>, is used as an escape character, any
occurrence of either of these bytes in a multiple-byte character shall
be preceded by the ASCII code for the SOLIDUS (2Fh).

EXAMPLE A file name containing the 2-byte character code \< 89 5C \> is
written as \< 89 5C 5C \>. When the application encounters this sequence
of bytes in a file name, it replaces the sequence with the original
2-byte code.

**7.11.3 File Specification Dictionaries**

The dictionary form of file specification provides more flexibility than
the string form, allowing different files to be specified for different
file systems or platforms, or for file systems other than the standard
ones (DOS/Windows, Mac OS, and UNIX). Table 44 shows the entries in a
file specification dictionary. Regardless of the platform, conforming
readers should use the **F** and **UF** (beginning with PDF 1.7) entries
to specify files. The **UF** entry is optional, but should be included
because it enables cross-platform and cross-language compatibility.

**7.11.4 Embedded File Streams**

> **7.11.4.1 General**

If a PDF file contains file specifications that refer to an external
file and the PDF file is archived or transmitted, some provision should
be made to ensure that the external references will remain valid. One
way to do this is to arrange for copies of the external files to
accompany the PDF file. *Embedded file streams (PDF 1.3)* address this
problem by allowing the contents of referenced files to be embedded
directly within the body of the PDF file. This makes the PDF file a
self-contained unit that can be stored or transmitted as a single
entity. (The embedded files are included purely for convenience and need
not be directly processed by any conforming reader.)

NOTE If the file contains OPI (Open Prepress Interface) dictionaries
that refer to externally stored high-resolution images (see 14.11.7,
\"Open Prepress Interface (OPI)\"), the image data can be incorporated
into the PDF file with embedded file streams.

An embedded file stream shall be included in a PDF document in one of
the following ways:

- Any file specification dictionary in the document may have an **EF**
  entry that specifies an embedded file stream. The stream data shall
  still be associated with a location in the file system. In particular,
  this method shall be used for file attachment annotations (see
  12.5.6.15, \"File Attachment Annotations\"), which associate the
  embedded file with a location on a page in the document.

- Embedded file streams may be associated with the document as a whole
  through the **EmbeddedFiles** entry (*PDF 1.4*) in the PDF document's
  name dictionary (see 7.7.4, \"Name Dictionary\"). The associated name
  tree shall map name strings to file specifications that refer to
  embedded file streams through their **EF** entries.

Beginning with PDF 1.6, the ***Desc*** entry of the file specification
dictionary (see Table 44) should be used to provide a textual
description of the embedded file, which can be displayed in the user
interface of a conforming reader. Previously, it was necessary to
identify document-level embedded files by the name string provided in
the name dictionary associated with an embedded file stream in much the
same way that the JavaScript name tree associates name strings with
document-level JavaScript actions (see 12.6.4.16, \"JavaScript
Actions\").

The stream dictionary describing an embedded file shall contain the
standard entries for any stream, such as **Length** and **Filter** (see
Table 5), as well as the additional entries shown in Table 45.

                                  checksum shall be calculated by
                                  applying the standard MD5
                                  message-digest algorithm (described in

For Mac OS files, the **Mac** entry in the embedded file parameter
dictionary should hold a further subdictionary containing Mac
OS--specific file information. Table 47 shows the contents of this

> **7.11.4.2 Related Files Arrays**

In some circumstances, a PDF file can refer to a group of related files,
such as the set of five files that make up a DCS 1.0 colour-separated
image. The file specification explicitly names only one of the files;
the rest shall be identified by some systematic variation of that file
name (such as by altering the extension). When such a file is to be
embedded in a PDF file, the related files shall be embedded as well.
This is accomplished by including a *related files array (PDF 1.3)* as
the value of the **RF** entry in the file specification dictionary. The
array shall have 2 ¥ *n* elements, which shall be paired in the form

> \[ *string*~1~ *stream*~1~ *string*~2~ *stream*~2~
>
> ...
>
> *string~n~* *stream~n~*
>
> \]

The first element of each pair shall be a string giving the name of one
of the related files; the second element shall be an embedded file
stream holding the file's contents.

EXAMPLE In the following example, objects 21, 31, and 41 are embedded
file streams containing the DOS file SUNSET. EPS, the Mac OS file Sunset
. eps, and the UNIX file Sunset . eps, respectively. The file
specification dictionary's RF entry specifies an array, object 30,
identifying a set of embedded files related to the Mac OS file, forming
a DCS 1.0 set. The example shows only the first two embedded file
streams in the set; an actual PDF file would, of course, include all of
them.

**7.11.5 URL Specifications**

When the **FS** entry in a file specification dictionary has the value
**URL**, the value of the **F** entry in that dictionary is not a file
specification string, but a uniform resource locator (URL) of the form
defined in Internet RFC 1738, *Uniform Resource Locators* (see the
Bibliography).

EXAMPLE The following example shows a URL specification.

> \<\< /FS /URL
>
> /F ( ftp : / / www . beatles . com / Movies / AbbeyRoad . mov )
>
> \>\>

The URL shall adhere to the character-encoding requirements specified in
RFC 1738. Because 7-bit U.S. ASCII is a strict subset of
**PDFDocEncoding**, this value shall also be considered to be in that
encoding.

**7.11.6 Collection Items**

Beginning with PDF 1.7, a *collection item dictionary* shall contain the
data described by the collection schema dictionary for a particular file
in a collection (see 12.3.5, \"Collections\"). Table 48 describes the
entries in a collection item dictionary.

|         |            |                                           |
|         |            | A single collection item dictionary may   |
|         |            | contain multiple entries, with one entry  |

A *collection subitem dictionary* provides the data corresponding to the
related fields in the collection dictionary, and it provides a means of
associating a prefix string with that data value. The prefix shall be
ignored by the sorting algorithm. Table 49 describes the entries in a
collection subitem dictionary.

**7.11.7 Maintenance of File Specifications**

The techniques described in this sub-clause can be used to maintain the
integrity of the file specifications within a PDF file during the
following types of operations:

- Updating the relevant file specification when a referenced file is
  renamed

- Determining the complete collection of files that are copied to a
  mirror site

- When creating new links to external files, discovering existing file
  specifications that refer to the same files and sharing them

- Finding the file specifications associated with embedded files to be
  packed or unpacked

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | It is not possible, in general, to find all file          |
| 1    | specification strings in a PDF file because there is no   |
|      | way to determine whether a given string is a file         |
|      | specification string. It is possible, however, to find    |
|      | all file specification *dictionaries*, provided that they |
|      | meet the following conditions:                            |
|      |                                                           |
|      | They are indirect objects.                                |
|      |                                                           |
|      | They contain a **Type** entry whose value is the name     |
|      | **Filespec**.                                             |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | A conforming reader can locate all of the file            |
| 2    | specification dictionaries by traversing the PDF file's   |
|      | crossreference table (see 7.5.4, \"Cross-Reference        |
|      | Table\") and finding all dictionaries with **Type** keys  |
|      | whose value is **Filespec**. For this reason, all file    |
|      | specifications should be expressed in dictionary form and |
|      | meet the conditions stated above. Any file specification  |
|      | dictionary specifying embedded files (that is, one that   |
|      | contains an **EF** entry) should satisfy these conditions |
|      | (see Table 44).                                           |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE 3 It may not be possible to locate file specification dictionaries
that are direct objects, since they are neither selftyped nor
necessarily reachable by any standard path of object references.

NOTE 4 Files may be embedded in a PDF file either directly, using the
**EF** entry in a file specification dictionary, or indirectly, using
related files arrays specified in the **RF** entry. If a file is
embedded indirectly, its name is given by the string that precedes the
embedded file stream in the related files array. If it is embedded
directly, its name is obtained from the value of the corresponding entry
in the file specification dictionary.

EXAMPLE The EXAMPLE in 7.11.4.2, \"Related Files Arrays,\" for instance,
shows the **EF** dictionary having a DOS entry identifying object number
21 as an embedded file stream. The name of the embedded DOS file,
SUNSET. EPS, is given by the DOS entry in the file specification
dictionary.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | A given external file may be referenced from more than    |
| 5    | one file specification. Therefore, when embedding a file  |
|      | with a given name, it is recommended to check for other   |
|      | occurrences of the same name as the value associated with |
|      | the corresponding key in other file specification         |
|      | dictionaries. This requires finding all embeddable file   |
|      | specifications and, for each matching key, checking for   |
|      | both of the following conditions:                         |
|      |                                                           |
|      | The string value associated with the key matches the name |
|      | of the file being embedded.                               |
|      |                                                           |
|      | A file has not already been embedded for the file         |
|      | specification.                                            |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | If there is already a corresponding key in the **EF**     |
| 6    | dictionary, a file has already been embedded for that use |
|      | of the file name.                                         |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | Files associated with a given file name need not be       |
| 7    | unique. The same file name, such as readme . txt, may be  |
|      | associated with different embedded files in distinct file |
|      | specifications.                                           |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

### 7.12 Extensions Dictionary

**7.12.1 General**

The extensions dictionary, an entry in the document's catalog
dictionary, if present, shall contain one or more entries identifying
developer-defined extensions to the ISO 32000-1 Standard. An extensions
dictionary, not shown, may optionally contain a **Type** entry whose
value is the name **Extensions**. The keys in the extensions dictionary
shall be names consisting only of the registered prefixes, described in
Annex E, of the developers whose extensions are being used. The values
shall be developer extensions dictionaries specifying developerdefined
version information as shown in Table 50. The extensions dictionary, all
developer extensions dictionary entries in the extensions dictionary, as
well as their entries, all shall be direct objects (i.e., this
information shall be nested directly within the catalog dictionary with
no indirect objects used).

**7.12.2 Developer Extensions Dictionary**

Table 50 describes the entries in a developer extensions dictionary.

> **Table 50 -- Entries in a developer extensions dictionary**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**              **Type**   **Value**
  -------------------- ---------- -------------------------------------------
  **Type**             name       (*Optional*) The type of PDF object that
                                  this dictionary describes; if present,
                                  shall be **DeveloperExtensions**.

  **BaseVersion**      name       (*Required*) The name of the PDF version to
                                  which this extension applies. The name
                                  shall be consistent with the syntax used
                                  for the **Version** entry of the catalog
                                  dictionary (see 7.7.2, "Document Catalog").

  **ExtensionLevel**   integer    (*Required*) An integer defined by the
                                  developer to denote the extension being
                                  used. If the developer introduces more than
                                  one extension to a given **BaseVersion**
                                  the extension level numbers assigned by
                                  that developer shall increase over time.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**7.12.3 BaseVersion**

The value of the **BaseVersion** entry shall be a name and shall be
consistent with the syntax used for the **Version** entry value of the
catalog dictionary (see 7.7.2, "Document Catalog"). The value of
**BaseVersion**, when treated as a version number, shall be less than or
equal to the PDF version, both in the document header (see 7.5.2, "File
Header") and the catalog **Version** key value, if present. The value of
**BaseVersion** may be different from the version number in the document
header or that supplied by the **Version** key in the **Catalog**. This
is because it reflects the version of the standard that has been
extended and not the version of this particular file.

NOTE 1 The value of **BaseVersion** is not to be interpreted as a real
number but as two integers with a PERIOD (2Eh) between them.

**7.12.4 ExtensionLevel**

The value of the **ExtensionLeve**l entry shall be an integer, which
shall be interpreted with respect to the **BaseVersion** value. If a
developer has released multiple extensions against the same
**BaseVersion** value, they shall be ordered over time and the
**ExtensionsLeve**l numbers shall be a monotonically increasing sequence
over time.

## 8 Graphics

### 8.1 General

The graphics operators used in PDF content streams describe the
appearance of pages that are to be reproduced on a raster output device.
The facilities described in this clause are intended for both printer
and display applications.

The graphics operators form six main groups:

- *Graphics state operators* manipulate the data structure called the
  *graphics state*, the global framework within which the other graphics
  operators execute. The graphics state includes the *current
  transformation matrix* (CTM), which maps user space coordinates used
  within a PDF content stream into output device coordinates. It also
  includes the *current colour*, the *current clipping path*, and many
  other parameters that are implicit operands of the painting operators.

- *Path construction operators* specify *paths*, which define shapes,
  line trajectories, and regions of various sorts. They include
  operators for beginning a new path, adding line segments and curves to
  it, and closing it.

- *Path-painting operators* fill a path with a colour, paint a stroke
  along it, or use it as a clipping boundary.

- *Other painting operators* paint certain self-describing graphics
  objects. These include sampled images, geometrically defined shadings,
  and entire content streams that in turn contain sequences of graphics
  operators.

- *Text operators* select and show *character glyphs* from *fonts*
  (descriptions of typefaces for representing text characters). Because
  PDF treats glyphs as general graphical shapes, many of the text
  operators could be grouped with the graphics state or painting
  operators. However, the data structures and mechanisms for dealing
  with glyph and font descriptions are sufficiently specialized that
  clause 9, \"Text\" focuses on them.

- *Marked-content operators* associate higher-level logical information
  with objects in the content stream. This information does not affect
  the rendered appearance of the content (although it may determine if
  the content should be presented at all; see 8.11, \"Optional
  Content\"); it is useful to applications that use PDF for document
  interchange. Marked content is described in 14.6, \"Marked Content\".

This clause presents general information about device-independent
graphics in PDF: how a PDF content stream describes the abstract
appearance of a page. *Rendering*---the device-dependent part of
graphics---is covered in clause 10, \"Rendering\". The Bibliography
lists a number of books that give details of these computer graphics
concepts and their implementation.

### 8.2 Graphics Objects

As discussed in 7.8.2, \"Content Streams\", the data in a content stream
shall be interpreted as a sequence of *operators* and their *operands*,
expressed as basic data objects according to standard PDF syntax. A
content stream can describe the appearance of a page, or it can be
treated as a graphical element in certain other contexts.

The operands and operators shall be written sequentially using postfix
notation. Although this notation resembles the sequential execution
model of the PostScript language, a PDF content stream is not a program
to be interpreted; rather, it is a static description of a sequence of
*graphics objects*. There are specific rules, described below, for
writing the operands and operators that describe a graphics object.

PDF provides five types of graphics objects:

- A *path object* is an arbitrary shape made up of straight lines,
  rectangles, and cubic Bézier curves. A path may intersect itself and
  may have disconnected sections and holes. A path object ends with one
  or more painting operators that specify whether the path shall be
  stroked, filled, used as a clipping boundary, or some combination of
  these operations.

- A *text object* consists of one or more character strings that
  identify sequences of glyphs to be painted. Like a path, text can be
  stroked, filled, or used as a clipping boundary.

- An *external object (XObject)* is an object defined outside the
  content stream and referenced as a named resource (see 7.8.3,
  \"Resource Dictionaries\"). The interpretation of an XObject depends
  on its type. An *image XObject* defines a rectangular array of colour
  samples to be painted; a *form XObject* is an entire content stream to
  be treated as a single graphics object. Specialized types of form
  XObjects shall be used to import content from one PDF file into
  another *(reference XObjects)* and to group graphical elements
  together as a unit for various purposes *(group XObjects)*. In
  particular, the latter are used to define *transparency groups* for
  use in the transparent imaging model (*transparency group XObjects*,
  discussed in detail in clause 11, \"Transparency\"). There is also a
  PostScript XObject that may appear in some existing PDF files, but it
  should not be used by a PDF 1.7 conforming writer.

- An *inline image object* uses a special syntax to express the data for
  a small image directly within the content stream.

- A *shading object* describes a geometric shape whose colour is an
  arbitrary function of position within the shape. (A shading can also
  be treated as a colour when painting other graphics objects; it is not
  considered to be a separate graphics object in that case.)

PDF 1.3 and earlier versions use an *opaque imaging model* in which each
graphics object is painted in sequence, completely obscuring any
previous marks it may overlay on the page. PDF 1.4 introduced a
*transparent imaging model* in which objects can be less than fully
opaque, allowing previously painted marks to show through. Each object
is painted on the page with a specified *opacity*, which may be constant
at every point within the object's shape or may vary from point to
point. The previously existing contents of the page form a *backdrop*
with which the new object is *composited*, producing results that
combine the colours of the object and backdrop according to their
respective opacity characteristics. The objects at any given point on
the page *forms* a *transparency stack*, where the stacking order is
defined to be the order in which the objects shall be specified,
bottommost object first. All objects in the stack can potentially
contribute to the result, depending on their colours, shapes, and
opacities.

PDF's graphics parameters are so arranged that objects shall be painted
by default with full opacity, reducing the behaviour of the transparent
imaging model to that of the opaque model. Accordingly, the material in
this clause applies to both the opaque and transparent models except
where explicitly stated otherwise; the transparent model is described in
its full generality in clause 11, \"Transparency\".

Although the painting behaviour described above is often attributed to
individual operators making up an object, it is always the object as a
whole that is painted. Figure 9 in Annex L shows the ordering rules for
the operations that define graphics objects. Some operations shall be
permitted only in certain types of graphics objects or in the intervals
between graphics objects (called the *page description level* in the
figure). Every content stream begins at the page description level,
where changes may be made to the graphics state, such as colours and
text attributes, as discussed in the following sub-clauses.

In the Figure 9 in Annex L, arrows indicate the operators that mark the
beginning or end of each type of graphics object. Some operators are
identified individually, others by general category. Table 51 summarizes
these categories for all PDF operators.

> **Figure 9 -- Graphics Objects**

EXAMPLE The path construction operators **m** and **re** signal the
beginning of a path object. Inside the path object, additional path
construction operators are permitted, as are the clipping path operators
**W** and **W\***, but not general graphics state operators such as
**w** or **J**. A path-painting operator, such as **S** or **f**, ends
the path object and returns to the page description level.

NOTE A conforming reader may process a content stream whose operations
violate these rules for describing graphics objects and can produce
unpredictable behaviour, even though it may display and print *the
stream* correctly. Applications that attempt to extract graphics objects
for editing or other purposes depend on the objects' being well formed.
The rules for graphics objects are also important for the proper
interpretation of marked content (see 14.6, \"Marked Content\").

A graphics object also implicitly includes all graphics state parameters
that affect its behaviour. For instance, a path object depends on the
value of the current colour parameter at the moment the path object is
defined. The effect shall be as if this parameter were specified as part
of the definition of the path object. However, the operators that are
invoked at the page description level to set graphics state parameters
shall not be considered to belong to any particular graphics object.
Graphics state parameters should be specified only when they change. A
graphics object can depend on parameters that were defined much earlier.

Similarly, the individual character strings within a text object
implicitly include the graphics state parameters on which they depend.
Most of these parameters may be set inside or outside the text object.
The effect is as if they were separately specified for each text string.

The important point is that there is no semantic significance to the
exact arrangement of graphics state operators. A conforming reader or
writer of a PDF content stream may change an arrangement of graphics
state operators to any other arrangement that achieves the same values
of the relevant graphics state parameters for each graphics object. A
conforming reader or writer shall not infer any higher-level logical
semantics from the arrangement of tokens constituting a graphics object.
A separate mechanism, *marked content* (see 14.6, \"Marked Content\"),
allows such higher-level information to be explicitly associated with
the graphics objects.

### 8.3 Coordinate Systems

**8.3.1 General**

Coordinate systems define the canvas on which all painting occurs. They
determine the position, orientation, and size of the text, graphics, and
images that appear on a page. This sub-clause describes each of the
coordinate systems used in PDF, how they are related, and how
transformations among them are specified.

NOTE The coordinate systems discussed in this sub-clause apply to
two-dimensional graphics. PDF 1.6 introduced the ability to display 3D
artwork, in which objects are described in a three-dimensional
coordinate system, as described in 13.6.5, \"Coordinate Systems for
3D\".

**8.3.2 Coordinate Spaces**

**8.3.2.1 General**

Paths and positions shall be defined in terms of pairs of *coordinates*
on the Cartesian plane. A coordinate pair is a pair of real numbers *x*
and *y* that locate a point horizontally and vertically within a
two-dimensional *coordinate space*. A coordinate space is determined by
the following properties with respect to the current page:

- The location of the origin

- The orientation of the *x* and *y* axes

- The lengths of the units along each axis

PDF defines several coordinate spaces in which the coordinates
specifying graphics objects shall be interpreted. The following
sub-clauses describe these spaces and the relationships among them.

Transformations among coordinate spaces shall be defined by
*transformation matrices*, which can specify any linear mapping of
two-dimensional coordinates, including translation, scaling, rotation,
reflection, and skewing. Transformation matrices are discussed in 8.3.3,
\"Common Transformations\" and 8.3.4, \"Transformation Matrices\".

**8.3.2.2 Device Space**

The contents of a page ultimately appear on a raster output device such
as a display or a printer. Such devices vary greatly in the built-in
coordinate systems they use to address pixels within their imageable
areas. A particular device's coordinate system is called its device
space. The origin of the device space on different devices can fall in
different places on the output page; on displays, the origin can vary
depending on the window system. Because the paper or other output medium
moves through different printers and imagesetters in different
directions, the axes of their device spaces may be oriented differently.
For instance, vertical (y) coordinates may increase from the top of the
page to the bottom on some devices and from bottom to top on others.
Finally, different devices have different resolutions; some even have
resolutions that differ in the horizontal and vertical directions.

NOTE If coordinates in a PDF file were specified in device space, the
file would be device-dependent and would appear differently on different
devices.

EXAMPLE Images specified in the typical device spaces of a
72-pixel-per-inch display and a 600-dot-per-inch printer would differ in
size by more than a factor of 8; an 8-inch line segment on the display
would appear less than 1 inch long on the printer. Figure 10 in Annex L
shows how the same graphics object, specified in device space, can
appear drastically different when rendered on different output devices.

> **Figure 10 -- Device Space**

**8.3.2.3 User Space**

To avoid the device-dependent effects of specifying objects in device
space, PDF defines a device-independent coordinate system that always
bears the same relationship to the current page, regardless of the
output device on which printing or displaying occurs. This
device-independent coordinate system is called *user space*.

The user space coordinate system shall be initialized to a default state
for each page of a document. The **CropBox** entry in the page
dictionary shall specify the rectangle of user space corresponding to
the visible area of the intended output medium (display window or
printed page). The positive *x* axis extends horizontally to the right
and the positive *y* axis vertically upward, as in standard mathematical
practice (subject to alteration by the **Rotate** entry in the page
dictionary). The length of a unit along both the *x* and *y* axes is set
by the **UserUnit** entry *(PDF 1.6)* in the page dictionary (see Table
30). If that entry is not present or supported, the default value of 1 ⁄
72 inch is used. This coordinate system is called *default user space*.

NOTE 1 In PostScript, the origin of default user space always
corresponds to the lower-left corner of the output medium. While this
convention is common in PDF documents as well, it is not required; the
page dictionary's ***CropBox*** entry can specify any rectangle of
default user space to be made visible on the medium.

NOTE 2 The default for the size of the unit in default user space (1 ⁄
72 inch) is approximately the same as a *point*, a unit widely used in
the printing industry. It is not exactly the same, however; there is no
universal definition of a point.

Conceptually, user space is an infinite plane. Only a small portion of
this plane corresponds to the imageable area of the output device: a
rectangular region defined by the **CropBox** entry in the page
dictionary. The region of default user space that is viewed or printed
can be different for each page and is described in 14.11.2, \"Page
Boundaries\".

Coordinates in user space (as in any other coordinate space) may be
specified as either integers or real numbers, and the unit size in
default user space does not constrain positions to any arbitrary grid.
The resolution of coordinates in user space is not related in any way to
the resolution of pixels in device space.

The transformation from user space to device space is defined by the
*current transformation matrix* (CTM), an element of the PDF graphics
state (see 8.4, \"Graphics State\"). A conforming reader can adjust the
CTM for the native resolution of a particular output device, maintaining
the device-independence of the PDF page description. Figure 11 in Annex
L shows how this allows an object specified in user space to appear the
same regardless of the device on which it is rendered.

NOTE 3 The default user space provides a consistent, dependable starting
place for PDF page descriptions regardless of the output device used. If
necessary, a PDF content stream may modify user space to be more
suitable to its needs by applying the *coordinate transformation
operator*, **cm** (see 8.4.4, \"Graphics State Operators\"). Thus, what
may appear to be absolute coordinates in a content stream are not
absolute with respect to the current page because they are expressed in
a coordinate system that may slide around and shrink or expand.
Coordinate system transformation not only enhances device-independence
but is a useful tool in its own right.

EXAMPLE A content stream originally composed to occupy an entire page
can be incorporated without change as an element of another page by
shrinking the coordinate system in which it is drawn.

> **Figure 11 -- User Space**

**8.3.2.4 Other Coordinate Spaces**

In addition to device space and user space, PDF uses a variety of other
coordinate spaces for specialized purposes:

- The coordinates of text shall be specified in *text space*. The
  transformation from text space to user space shall be defined by a
  *text matrix* in combination with several text-related parameters in
  the graphics state (see 9.4.2, \"Text-Positioning Operators\").

- Character glyphs in a font shall be defined in *glyph space* (see
  9.2.4, \"Glyph Positioning and Metrics\"). The transformation from
  glyph space to text space shall be defined by the *font matrix*. For
  most types of fonts, this matrix shall be predefined to map 1000 units
  of glyph space to 1 unit of text space; for Type 3 fonts, the font
  matrix shall be given explicitly in the font dictionary (see 9.6.5,
  \"Type 3 Fonts\").

- All sampled images shall be defined in *image space*. The
  transformation from image space to user space shall be predefined and
  cannot be changed. All images shall be 1 unit wide by 1 unit high in
  user space, regardless of the number of samples in the image. To be
  painted, an image shall be mapped to a region of the page by
  temporarily altering the CTM.

- A form XObject (discussed in 8.10, \"Form XObjects\") is a
  self-contained content stream that can be treated as a graphical
  element within another content stream. The space in which it is
  defined is called *form space*. The transformation from form space to
  user space shall be specified by a *form matrix* contained in the form
  XObject.

- PDF 1.2 defined a type of colour known as a *pattern*, discussed in
  8.7, \"Patterns\". A pattern shall be defined either by a content
  stream that shall be invoked repeatedly to tile an area or by a
  shading whose colour is a function of position. The space in which a
  pattern is defined is called *pattern space*. The transformation from
  pattern space to user space shall be specified by a *pattern matrix*
  contained in the pattern.

- PDF 1.6 embedded 3D artwork, which is described in three-dimensional
  coordinates (see 13.6.5, \"Coordinate Systems for 3D\") that are
  projected into an annotation's target coordinate system (see 13.6.2,
  \"3D Annotations\").

**8.3.2.5 Relationships among Coordinate Spaces**

Figure 12 in Annex L shows the relationships among the coordinate spaces
described above. Each arrow in the figure represents a transformation
from one coordinate space to another. PDF allows modifications to many
of these transformations.

Because PDF coordinate spaces are defined relative to one another,
changes made to one transformation can affect the appearance of objects
defined in several coordinate spaces.

EXAMPLE A change in the CTM, which defines the transformation from user
space to device space, affects forms, text, images, and patterns, since
they are all upstream from user space.

**8.3.3 Common Transformations**

A *transformation matrix* specifies the relationship between two
coordinate spaces. By modifying a transformation matrix, objects can be
scaled, rotated, translated, or transformed in other ways.

> **Figure 12 -- Relationships Among Coordinate Systems**

A transformation matrix in PDF shall be specified by six numbers,
usually in the form of an array containing six elements. In its most
general form, this array is denoted \[ *a* *b* *c* *d* *e* *f* \]; it
can represent any linear transformation from one coordinate system to
another. This sub-clause lists the arrays that specify the most common
transformations; 8.3.4, \"Transformation Matrices\", discusses more
mathematical details of transformations, including information on
specifying transformations that are combinations of those listed here:

- Translations shall be specified as \[ 1 0 0 1 *t~x~* *t~y~* \], where
  *t~x~* and *t~y~* shall be the distances to translate the origin of
  the coordinate system in the horizontal and vertical dimensions,
  respectively.

- Scaling shall be obtained by \[ *s~x~* 0 0 *s~y~* 0 0 \]. This scales
  the coordinates so that 1 unit in the horizontal and vertical
  dimensions of the new coordinate system is the same size as *s~x~* and
  *s~y~* units, respectively, in the previous coordinate system.

- Rotations shall be produced by \[ cos *q* sin *q* -sin *q* cos *q* 0 0
  \], which has the effect of rotating the coordinate system axes by an
  angle *q* counter clockwise.

- Skew shall be specified by \[ 1 tan *a* tan *b* 1 0 0 \], which skews
  the *x* axis by an angle *a* and the *y* axis by an angle *b*.

Figure 13 in Annex L shows examples of each transformation. The
directions of translation, rotation, and skew shown in the figure
correspond to positive values of the array elements.

> **Figure 13 -- Effects of Coordinate Transformations**

NOTE If several transformations are combined, the order in which they
are applied is significant. For example, first scaling and then
translating the *x* axis is not the same as first translating and then
scaling it. In general, to obtain the expected results, transformations
should be done in the following order: Translate, Rotate, Scale or skew.

> Figure 14 in Annex L shows the effect of the order in which
> transformations are applied. The figure shows two sequences of
> transformations applied to a coordinate system. After each successive
> transformation, an outline of the letter n is drawn.
>
> **Figure 14 -- Effect of Transformation Order**

NOTE The following transformations are shown in the figure: a
translation of 10 units in the *x* direction and 20 units in the *y*
direction; a rotation of 30 degrees; a scaling by a factor of 3 in the
*x* direction

> In the figure, the axes are shown with a dash pattern having a 2-unit
> dash and a 2-unit gap. In addition, the original (untransformed) axes
> are shown in a lighter colour for reference. Notice that the
> scale-rotate-translate ordering results in a distortion of the
> coordinate system, leaving the *x* and *y* axes no longer
> perpendicular; the recommended translate-rotate-scale ordering results
> in no distortion.

**8.3.4 Transformation Matrices**

This sub-clause discusses the mathematics of transformation matrices.

To understand the mathematics of coordinate transformations in PDF, it
is vital to remember two points:

- *Transformations alter coordinate systems, not graphics objects*. All
  objects painted before a transformation is applied shall be unaffected
  by the transformation. Objects painted after the transformation is
  applied shall be interpreted in the transformed coordinate system.

- *Transformation matrices specify the transformation from the new
  (transformed) coordinate system to the original (untransformed)
  coordinate system*. All coordinates used after the transformation
  shall be expressed in the transformed coordinate system. PDF applies
  the transformation matrix to find the equivalent coordinates in the
  untransformed coordinate system.

NOTE 1 Many computer graphics textbooks consider transformations of
graphics objects rather than of coordinate systems. Although either
approach is correct and self-consistent, some details of the
calculations differ depending on which point of view is taken.

PDF represents coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The point (*x*,
*y*) in such a space can be expressed in vector form as \[ *x* *y* 1 \].
The constant third element of this vector (1) is needed so that the
vector can be used with 3-by-3 matrices in the calculations described
below.

The transformation between two coordinate systems can be represented by
a 3-by-3 transformation matrix written as follows:

> a b 0 c d 0 e f 1

Because a transformation matrix has only six elements that can be
changed, in most cases in PDF it shall be specified as the six-element
array \[ *a b c d e f* \].

Coordinate transformations shall be expressed as matrix multiplications:

> a b 0 \[x′ y′ 1\] = \[x y 1\] ×c d 0

e f 1

Because PDF transformation matrices specify the conversion from the
transformed coordinate system to the original (untransformed) coordinate
system, *x* ¢ and *y* ¢ in this equation shall be the coordinates in the
untransformed coordinate system, and *x* and *y* shall be the
coordinates in the transformed system. The multiplication is carried out
as follows:

> x′ = a × x + c × y + e y′ = b × x + d × y + f

If a series of transformations is carried out, the matrices representing
each of the individual transformations can be multiplied together to
produce a single equivalent matrix representing the composite
transformation.

NOTE 2 Matrix multiplication is not commutative---the order in which
matrices are multiplied is significant. Consider a sequence of two
transformations: a scaling transformation applied to the user space
coordinate system, followed by a conversion from the resulting scaled
user space to device space. Let *M~S~* be the matrix specifying the
scaling and *M~C~* the current transformation matrix, which transforms
user space to device space. Recalling that coordinates are always
specified in the transformed space, the correct order of transformations
first converts the scaled coordinates to default user space and then
converts the default user space coordinates to device space. This can be
expressed as

> XD = XU × MC = (XS × MS) × MC = XS × (MS × MC

where

> *X~D~* denotes the coordinates in device space
>
> *X~U~* denotes the coordinates in default user space
>
> *X~S~* denotes the coordinates in scaled user space

This shows that when a new transformation is concatenated with an
existing one, the matrix representing it shall be multiplied *before*
(*premultiplied* with) the existing transformation matrix.

This result is true in general for PDF: when a sequence of
transformations is carried out, the matrix representing the combined
transformation *(M*¢*)* is calculated by premultiplying the matrix
representing the additional transformation *(M~T~ )* with the one
representing all previously existing transformations *(M)*:

> M′ = M~T~ × M

NOTE 3 When rendering graphics objects, it is sometimes necessary for a
conforming reader to perform the inverse of a transformation---that is,
to find the user space coordinates that correspond to a given pair of
device space

> coordinates. Not all transformations are invertible, however. For
> example, if a matrix contains *a*, *b*, *c*, and *d* elements that are
> all zero, all user coordinates map to the same device coordinates and
> there is no unique inverse transformation. Such noninvertible
> transformations are not very useful and generally arise from
> unintended operations, such as scaling by 0. Use of a noninvertible
> matrix when painting graphics objects can result in unpredictable
> behaviour.

###  8.4 Graphics State

**8.4.1 General**

A conforming reader shall maintain an internal data structure called the
*graphics state* that holds current graphics control parameters. These
parameters define the global framework within which the graphics
operators execute.

EXAMPLE 1 The **f** (fill) operator implicitly uses the current colour
parameter, and the **S** (stroke) operator additionally uses the current
line width parameter from the graphics state.

A conforming reader shall initialize the graphic state at the beginning
of each page with the values specified in Table 52 and Table 53. Table
52 lists those graphics state parameters that are device-independent and
are appropriate to specify in page descriptions. The parameters listed
in Table 53 control details of the rendering (scan conversion) process
and are device-dependent; a page description that is intended to be
deviceindependent should not be written to modify these parameters.

> **Table 52 -- Device-Independent Graphics State Parameters**

                               coordinates (see 8.3, \"Coordinate
                               Systems\"). This matrix is
                               modified by each application of

                               8.5.4, \"Clipping Path
                               Operators\"). Initial value: the

                  array        which colour values shall be
                               interpreted (see 8.6, \"Colour
                               Spaces\"). There are two separate
                               colour space parameters: one for
                               stroking and one for all other
                               painting operations. Initial
                               value: **DeviceGray**.

  color           (various)    The *current colour* to be used
                               during painting operations (see
                               8.6, \"Colour Spaces\"). The type

                               parameter depend on the current
                               colour space; for most colour
                               spaces, a colour value consists of
                               one to four numbers. There are two
                               separate colour parameters: one
                               for stroking and one for all other
                               painting operations. Initial
                               value: black.

  text state      (various)    A set of nine graphics state
                               parameters that pertain only to
                               the painting of text. These
                               include parameters that select the
                               font, scale the glyphs to an
                               appropriate size, and accomplish
                               other effects. The text state
                               parameters are described in 9.3,
                               \"Text State Parameters and
                               Operators\".

  line width      number       The thickness, in user space
                               units, of paths to be stroked (see

                  array, or     adjusts device gray or colour
                  name          component levels to compensate for
                                nonlinear response in a particular
                                output device (see 10.4, "Transfer

  halftone        dictionary,   *(PDF 1.2)* A halftone screen for
                  stream, or    gray and colour rendering,
                  name          specified as a halftone dictionary
                                or stream (see 10.5,
                                \"Halftones\"). Initial value: a
                                conforming reader shall initialize

  flatness        number        The precision with which curves
                                shall be rendered on the output
                                device (see 10.6.2, \"Flatness
                                Tolerance\"). The value of this
                                parameter (positive number) gives

  smoothness      number     *(PDF 1.3)* The precision with
                             which colour gradients are to be
                             rendered on the output device (see
                             10.6.3, \"Smoothness Tolerance\").
                             The value of this parameter (0 to
                             1.0) gives the maximum error

                             component; smaller numbers give
                             smoother colour transitions at the
                             expense of more computation and
                             memory use. Initial value: a
                             conforming reader shall initialize
                             this to a suitable device
                             dependent value.

  -------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 Some graphics state parameters are set with specific PDF
operators, some are set by including a particular entry in a graphics
state parameter dictionary, and some can be specified either way.

EXAMPLE 2 The current line width can be set either with the **w**
operator or (in PDF 1.3) with the **LW** entry in a graphics state
parameter dictionary, whereas the current colour is set only with
specific operators, and the current halftone is set only with a graphics
state parameter dictionary.

In general, a conforming reader, when interpreting the operators that
set graphics state parameters, shall simply store them unchanged for
later use when interpreting the painting operators.However, some
parameters have special properties or call for behaviour that a
conforming reader shall handle:

- Most parameters shall be of the correct type or have values that fall
  within a certain range.

- Parameters that are numeric values, such as the current colour, line
  width, and miter limit, shall be forced into valid range, if
  necessary. However, they shall not be adjusted to reflect capabilities
  of the raster output device, such as resolution or number of
  distinguishable colours. Painting operators perform such adjustments,
  but the adjusted values shall not be stored back into the graphics
  state.

- Paths shall be internal objects that shall not be directly represented
  in PDF.

NOTE 2 As indicated in Table 52 and Table 53, some of the
parameters---color space, color, and overprint---have two values, one
used for stroking (of paths and text objects) and one for all other
painting operations. The two parameter values can be set independently,
allowing for operations such as combined filling and stroking of the
same path with different colours. Except where noted, a term such as
*current colour* should be interpreted to refer to whichever colour
parameter applies to the operation being performed. When necessary, the
individual colour parameters are distinguished explicitly as the
*stroking colour* and the *nonstroking colour*.

**8.4.2 Graphics State Stack**

A PDF document typically contains many graphical elements that are
independent of each other and nested to multiple levels. The *graphics
state stack* allows these elements to make local changes to the graphics
state without disturbing the graphics state of the surrounding
environment. The stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure in
which the contents of the graphics state may be saved and later restored
using the following operators:

- The **q** operator shall push a copy of the entire graphics state onto
  the stack.

- The **Q** operator shall restore the entire graphics state to its
  former value by popping it from the stack.

NOTE These operators can be used to encapsulate a graphical element so
that it can modify parameters of the graphics state and later restore
them to their previous values.

Occurrences of the **q** and **Q** operators shall be balanced within a
given content stream (or within the sequence of streams specified in a
page dictionary's **Contents** array).

**8.4.3 Details of Graphics State Parameters**

**8.4.3.1 General**

This sub-clause gives details of several of the device-independent
graphics state parameters listed in Table 52.

**8.4.3.2 Line Width**

The *line width* parameter specifies the thickness of the line used to
stroke a path. It shall be a non-negative number expressed in user space
units; stroking a path shall entail painting all points whose
perpendicular distance from the path in user space is less than or equal
to half the line width. The effect produced in device space depends on
the current transformation matrix (CTM) in effect at the time the path
is stroked. If the CTM specifies scaling by different factors in the
horizontal and vertical dimensions, the thickness of stroked lines in
device space shall vary according to their orientation. The actual line
width achieved can differ from the requested width by as much as 2
device pixels, depending on the positions of lines with respect to the
pixel grid. Automatic stroke adjustment may be used to ensure uniform
line width; see 10.6.5, \"Automatic Stroke Adjustment\".

A line width of 0 shall denote the thinnest line that can be rendered at
device resolution: 1 device pixel wide. However, some devices cannot
reproduce 1-pixel lines, and on high-resolution devices, they are nearly
invisible. Since the results of rendering such zero-width lines are
device-dependent, they should not be used.

**8.4.3.3 Line Cap Style**

The *line cap style* shall specify the shape that shall be used at the
ends of open subpaths (and dashes, if any) when they are stroked. Table
54 shows the possible values.

> **Table 54 -- Line Cap Styles**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Style**   **Appearance**   **Description**
  ----------- ---------------- --------------------------------------
  0                            *Butt cap*. The stroke shall be
                               squared off at the endpoint of the
                               path. There shall be no projection
                               beyond the end of the path.

  1                            *Round cap*. A semicircular arc with a
                               diameter equal to the line width shall
                               be drawn around the endpoint and shall
                               be filled in.

  2                            *Projecting square cap*. The stroke
                               shall continue beyond the endpoint of
                               the path for a distance equal to half
                               the line width and shall be squared
                               off.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

**8.4.3.4 Line Join Style**

The *line join style* shall specify the shape to be used at the corners
of paths that are stroked. Table 55 shows the possible values. Join
styles shall be significant only at points where consecutive segments of
a path connect at an angle; segments that meet or intersect fortuitously
shall receive no special treatment.

> **Table 55 -- Line Join Styles**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Style**   **Appearance**   **Description**
  ----------- ---------------- ---------------------------------------
  0                            *Miter join*. The outer edges of the
                               strokes for the two segments shall be
                               extended until they meet at an angle,
                               as in a picture frame. If the segments
                               meet at too sharp an angle (as defined
                               by the miter limit parameter---see
                               8.4.3.5, \"Miter Limit\"), a bevel join
                               shall be used instead.

|             |                | > filled with a triangle.             |
+-------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+

NOTE The definition of round join was changed in PDF 1.5. In rare cases,
the implementation of the previous specification could produce
unexpected results.

**8.4.3.5 Miter Limit**

When two line segments meet at a sharp angle and mitered joins have been
specified as the line join style, it is possible for the miter to extend
far beyond the thickness of the line stroking the path. The *miter
limit* shall impose a maximum on the ratio of the miter length to the
line width (see Figure 15 in Annex L). When the limit is exceeded, the
join is converted from a miter to a bevel.

The ratio of miter length to line width is directly related to the angle
*j* between the segments in user space by the following formula:

> *^miterLength^*\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--
> = \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--^1^ *lineWidth* sin⎛^ϕ^\-\--⎞
>
> ⎝ 2⎠

EXAMPLE A miter limit of 1.414 converts miters to bevels for j less than
90 degrees, a limit of 2.0 converts them for j less than 60 degrees, and
a limit of 10.0 converts them for j less than approximately 11.5
degrees.

> **Figure 15 -- Miter Length**

**8.4.3.6 Line Dash Pattern**

The *line dash pattern* shall control the pattern of dashes and gaps
used to stroke paths. It shall be specified by a *dash array* and a
*dash phase*. The dash array's elements shall be numbers that specify
the lengths of alternating dashes and gaps; the numbers shall be
nonnegative and not all zero. The dash phase shall specify the distance
into the dash pattern at which to start the dash. The elements of both
the dash array and the dash phase shall be expressed in user space
units.

Before beginning to stroke a path, the dash array shall be cycled
through, adding up the lengths of dashes and gaps. When the accumulated
length equals the value specified by the dash phase, stroking of the
path shall begin, and the dash array shall be used cyclically from that
point onward. Table 56 shows examples of line dash patterns. As can be
seen from the table, an empty dash array and zero phase can be used to
restore the dash pattern to a solid line.

+-----------+------------------+---------------------+
| > \[ 3 \] |                  | > 3 units on, 3     |
| > 0       |                  | > units off, ...    |

| > \[ 2 \] |                  | > 1 on, 2 off, 2    |
| > 1       |                  | > on, 2 off, ...    |
+-----------+------------------+---------------------+
| \[ 2 1 \] |                  | 2 on, 1 off, 2 on,  |
| 0         |                  | 1 off, ...          |
+-----------+------------------+---------------------+
| \[ 3 5 \] |                  | 2 off, 3 on, 5 off, |
| 6         |                  | 3 on, 5 off, ...    |
+-----------+------------------+---------------------+
| \[ 2 3 \] |                  | 1 on, 3 off, 2 on,  |
| 11        |                  | 3 off, 2 on, ...    |
+-----------+------------------+---------------------+

Dashed lines shall wrap around curves and corners just as solid stroked
lines do. The ends of each dash shall be treated with the current line
cap style, and corners within dashes shall be treated with the current
line join style. A stroking operation shall take no measures to
coordinate the dash pattern with features of the path; it simply shall
dispense dashes and gaps along the path in the pattern defined by the
dash array.

When a path consisting of several subpaths is stroked, each subpath
shall be treated independently---that is, the dash pattern shall be
restarted and the dash phase shall be reapplied to it at the beginning
of each subpath.

**8.4.4 Graphics State Operators**

Table 57 shows the operators that set the values of parameters in the
graphics state. (See also the colour operators listed in Table 74 and
the text state operators in Table 105.)

> **Table 57 -- Graphics State Operators**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Operands**   **Operator**   **Description**
  -------------- -------------- --------------------------------------
  ---            **q**          Save the current graphics state on the
                                graphics state stack (see 8.4.2,
                                \"Graphics State Stack\").

  ---            **Q**          Restore the graphics state by removing
                                the most recently saved state from the
                                stack and making it the current state
                                (see 8.4.2, \"Graphics State Stack\").

                                \"Coordinate Spaces\"). Although the
                                operands specify a matrix, they shall
                                be written as six separate numbers,
                                not as an array.

  *lineWidth*    **w**          Set the line width in the graphics
                                state (see 8.4.3.2, \"Line Width\").

  *lineCap*      **J**          Set the line cap style in the graphics
                                state (see 8.4.3.3, \"Line Cap
                                Style\").

  *lineJoin*     **j**          Set the line join style in the
                                graphics state (see 8.4.3.4, \"Line
                                Join Style\").

  *miterLimit*   **M**          Set the miter limit in the graphics
                                state (see 8.4.3.5, \"Miter Limit\").

  *dashArray*    **d**          Set the line dash pattern in the
  *dashPhase*                   graphics state (see 8.4.3.6, \"Line
                                Dash Pattern\").

  *intent*       **ri**         *(PDF 1.1)* Set the colour rendering
                                intent in the graphics state (see
                                8.6.5.8, \"Rendering Intents\").

**8.4.5 Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries**

While some parameters in the graphics state may be set with individual
operators, as shown in Table 57, others may not. The latter may only be
set with the generic graphics state operator **gs** *(PDF 1.2).* The
operand supplied to this operator shall be the name of a *graphics state
parameter dictionary* whose contents specify the values of one or more
graphics state parameters. This name shall be looked up in the
**ExtGState** subdictionary of the current resource dictionary.

The graphics state parameter dictionary is also used by type 2 patterns,
which do not have a content stream in which the graphics state operators
could be invoked (see 8.7.4, \"Shading Patterns\").

Each entry in the parameter dictionary shall specify the value of an
individual graphics state parameter, as shown in Table 58. All entries
need not be present for every invocation of the **gs** operator; the
supplied parameter dictionary may include any combination of parameter
entries. The results of **gs** shall be cumulative; parameter values
established in previous invocations persist until explicitly overridden.

NOTE Note that some parameters appear in both Table 57 and Table 58;
these parameters can be set either with individual graphics state
operators or with **gs**. It is expected that any future extensions to
the graphics state will be implemented by adding new entries to the
graphics state parameter dictionary rather than by introducing new
graphics state operators.

|           |             | **op** entry in the same graphics     |
|           |             | state parameter dictionary, in which  |

EXAMPLE The following shows two graphics state parameter dictionaries.
In the first, automatic stroke adjustment is turned on, and the
dictionary includes a transfer function that inverts its value, *f*
(*x*) = 1 - *x*. In the second, overprint is turned off, and the
dictionary includes a parabolic transfer function, *f* (*x*) =
(2*x* - 1) ^2^, with a sample of 21 values. The domain of the transfer
function, \[ 0.0 1.0 \], is mapped to \[ 0 20 \], and the range of the
sample values, \[ 0 255 \], is mapped to the range of the transfer
function, \[ 0.0 1.0 \].

###  8.5 Path Construction and Painting

**8.5.1 General**

*Paths* define shapes, trajectories, and regions of all sorts. They
shall be used to draw lines, define the shapes of filled areas, and
specify boundaries for clipping other graphics. The graphics state shall
include a *current clipping path* that shall define the clipping
boundary for the current page. At the beginning of each page, the
clipping path shall be initialized to include the entire page.

A path shall be composed of straight and curved line segments, which may
connect to one another or may be disconnected. A pair of segments shall
be said to *connect* only if they are defined consecutively, with the
second segment starting where the first one ends. Thus, the order in
which the segments of a path are defined shall be significant.
Nonconsecutive segments that meet or intersect fortuitously shall not be
considered to connect.

NOTE A path is made up of one or more disconnected *subpaths*, each
comprising a sequence of connected segments. The topology of the path is
unrestricted: it may be concave or convex, may contain multiple subpaths
representing disjoint areas, and may intersect itself in arbitrary ways.

The **h** operator explicitly shall connect the end of a subpath back to
its starting point; such a subpath is said to be *closed*. A subpath
that has not been explicitly closed is said to be *open*.

As discussed in 8.2, \"Graphics Objects\", a path object is defined by a
sequence of operators to construct the path, followed by one or more
operators to paint the path or to use it as a clipping boundary. PDF
path operators fall into three categories:

- *Path construction operators* (8.5.2, \"Path Construction Operators\")
  define the geometry of a path. A path is constructed by sequentially
  applying one or more of these operators.

- *Path-painting operators* (8.5.3, \"Path-Painting Operators\") end a
  path object, usually causing the object to be painted on the current
  page in any of a variety of ways.

- *Clipping path operators* (8.5.4, \"Clipping Path Operators\"),
  invoked immediately before a path-painting operator, cause the path
  object also to be used for clipping of subsequent graphics objects.

**8.5.2 Path Construction Operators**

**8.5.2.1 General**

A page description shall begin with an empty path and shall build up its
definition by invoking one or more path construction operators to add
segments to it. The path construction operators may be invoked in any
sequence, but the first one invoked shall be **m** or **re** to begin a
new subpath. The path definition may conclude with the application of a
path-painting operator such as **S**, **f**, or **b** (see 8.5.3,
\"Path-Painting Operators\"); this operator may optionally be preceded
by one of the clipping path operators **W** or **W\*** (8.5.4,
\"Clipping Path Operators\").

NOTE Note that the path construction operators do not place any marks on
the page; only the painting operators do that. A path definition is not
complete until a path-painting operator has been applied to it.

The path currently under construction is called the *current path*. In
PDF (unlike PostScript), the current path is *not* part of the graphics
state and is *not* saved and restored along with the other graphics
state parameters. PDF paths shall be strictly internal objects with no
explicit representation. After the current path has been painted, it
shall become no longer defined; there is then no current path until a
new one is begun with the **m** or **re** operator.

The trailing endpoint of the segment most recently added to the current
path is referred to as the *current point.* If the current path is
empty, the current point shall be undefined. Most operators that add a
segment to the current path start at the current point; if the current
point is undefined, an error shall be generated.

Table 59 shows the path construction operators. All operands shall be
numbers denoting coordinates in user space.

+--------------+----------------+----------------------------------+

**8.5.2.2 Cubic Bézier Curves**

Curved path segments shall be specified as *cubic Bézier curves*. Such
curves shall be defined by four points: the two endpoints (the current
point *P*~0~ and the final point *P*~3~ ) and two *control points*
*P*~1~ and *P*~2~ . Given the coordinates of the four points, the curve
shall be generated by varying the parameter *t* from 0.0 to 1.0 in the
following equation:

> *R t*( ) = (1 -- *t*)^3^*P*~0~ + 3*t*(1 -- *t*)^2^*P*~1~ + 3*t*^2^(1
> -- *t*)*P*~2~ + *t*^3^*P*~3~

When *t* = 0.0, the value of the function *R* (*t*) coincides with the
current point *P*~0~ ; when *t* = 1.0, *R* (*t*) coincides with the
final point *P*~3~ . Intermediate values of *t* generate intermediate
points along the curve. The curve does not, in general, pass through the
two control points *P*~1~ and *P*~2~ .

NOTE 1 Cubic Bézier curves have two useful properties:

> The curve can be very quickly split into smaller pieces for rapid
> rendering.
>
> The curve is contained within the convex hull of the four points
> defining the curve, most easily visualized as the polygon obtained by
> stretching a rubber band around the outside of the four points. This
> property allows rapid testing of whether the curve lies completely
> outside the visible region, and hence does not have to be rendered.

NOTE 2 The Bibliography lists several books that describe cubic Bézier
curves in more depth.

The most general PDF operator for constructing curved path segments is
the **c** operator, which specifies the coordinates of points *P*~1~ ,
*P*~2~ , and *P*~3~ explicitly, as shown in Figure 16 in Annex L. (The
starting point, *P*~0~ , is defined implicitly by the current point.)

> **Figure 16 -- Cubic Bézier Curve Generated by the c Operator**

Two more operators, **v** and **y**, each specify one of the two control
points implicitly (see Figure 17 in Annex L). In both of these cases,
one control point and the final point of the curve shall be supplied as
operands; the other control point shall be implied:

- For the **v** operator, the first control point shall coincide with
  initial point of the curve.

- For the **y** operator, the second control point shall coincide with
  final point of the curve.

> **Figure 17 -- Cubic Bézier Curves Generated by the v and y
> Operators**

**8.5.3 Path-Painting Operators**

**8.5.3.1 General**

The path-painting operators end a path object, causing it to be painted
on the current page in the manner that the operator specifies. The
principal path-painting operators shall be **S** (for *stroking*) and
**f** (for *filling*). Variants of these operators combine stroking and
filling in a single operation or apply different rules for determining
the area to be filled. Table 60 lists all the path-painting operators.

|              |              | open shall be implicitly closed before   |

+--------------+--------------+------------------------------------------+

**8.5.3.2 Stroking**

The **S** operator shall paint a line along the current path. The
stroked line shall follow each straight or curved segment in the path,
centred on the segment with sides parallel to it. Each of the path's
subpaths shall be treated separately.

The results of the **S** operator shall depend on the current settings
of various parameters in the graphics state (see 8.4, \"Graphics
State\", for further information on these parameters):

- The width of the stroked line shall be determined by the current line
  width parameter (8.4.3.2, \"Line Width\").

- The colour or pattern of the line shall be determined by the current
  colour and colour space for stroking operations.

- The line may be painted either solid or with a dash pattern, as
  specified by the current line dash pattern (see 8.4.3.6, \"Line Dash
  Pattern\").

- If a subpath is open, the unconnected ends shall be treated according
  to the current line cap style, which may be butt, rounded, or square
  (see 8.4.3.3, \"Line Cap Style\").

- Wherever two consecutive segments are connected, the joint between
  them shall be treated according to the current *line join* style,
  which may be mitered, rounded, or beveled (see 8.4.3.4, \"Line Join
  Style\"). Mitered joins shall be subject to the current miter limit
  (see 8.4.3.5, \"Miter Limit\").

Points at which unconnected segments happen to meet or intersect receive
no special treatment. In particular, using an explicit **l** operator to
give the appearance of closing a subpath, rather than using **h**, may
result in a messy corner, because line caps are applied instead of a
line join.

- The *stroke adjustment* parameter *(PDF 1.2)* specifies that
  coordinates and line widths be adjusted automatically to produce
  strokes of uniform thickness despite rasterization effects (see
  10.6.5, \"Automatic Stroke Adjustment\").

If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed path or of
two or more points at the same coordinates), the **S** operator shall
paint it only if round line caps have been specified, producing a filled
circle centered at the single point. If butt or projecting square line
caps have been specified, **S** shall produce no output, because the
orientation of the caps would be indeterminate. This rule shall apply
only to zero-length subpaths of the path being stroked, and not to
zero-length dashes in a dash pattern. In the latter case, the line caps
shall always be painted, since their orientation is determined by the
direction of the underlying path. A single-point open subpath (specified
by a trailing **m** operator) shall produce no output.

**8.5.3.3 Filling**

> **8.5.3.3.1 General**

The **f** operator shall use the current nonstroking colour to paint the
entire region enclosed by the current path. If the path consists of
several disconnected subpaths, **f** shall paint the insides of all
subpaths, considered together. Any subpaths that are open shall be
implicitly closed before being filled.

If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed path or of
two or more points at the same coordinates), **f** shall paint the
single device pixel lying under that point; the result is
device-dependent and not generally useful. A single-point open subpath
(specified by a trailing **m** operator) shall produce no output.

For a simple path, it is intuitively clear what region lies inside.
However, for a more complex path, it is not always obvious which points
lie inside the path. For more detailed information, see 10.6.4, "Scan
Conversion Rules".

EXAMPLE A path that intersects itself or has one subpath that encloses
another.

The path machinery shall use one of two rules for determining which
points lie inside a path: the nonzero winding number rule and the
even-odd rule, both discussed in detail below. The nonzero winding
number rule is more versatile than the even-odd rule and shall be the
standard rule the **f** operator uses. Similarly, the **W** operator
shall use this rule to determine the inside of the current clipping
path. The even-odd rule is occasionally useful for special effects or
for compatibility with other graphics systems; the **f\*** and **W\***
operators invoke this rule.

> **8.5.3.3.2 Nonzero Winding Number Rule**

The *nonzero winding number rule* determines whether a given point is
inside a path by conceptually drawing a ray from that point to infinity
in any direction and then examining the places where a segment of the
path crosses the ray. Starting with a count of 0, the rule adds 1 each
time a path segment crosses the ray from left to right and subtracts 1
each time a segment crosses from right to left. After counting all the
crossings, if the result is 0, the point is outside the path; otherwise,
it is inside.

The method just described does not specify what to do if a path segment
coincides with or is tangent to the chosen ray. Since the direction of
the ray is arbitrary, the rule simply chooses a ray that does not
encounter such problem intersections.

For simple convex paths, the nonzero winding number rule defines the
inside and outside as one would intuitively expect. The more interesting
cases are those involving complex or self-intersecting paths like the
ones shown in Figure 18 in Annex L. For a path consisting of a
five-pointed star, drawn with five connected straight line segments
intersecting each other, the rule considers the inside to be the entire
area enclosed by the star, including the pentagon in the centre. For a
path composed of two concentric circles, the areas enclosed by both
circles are considered to be inside, provided that both are drawn in the
same direction. If the circles are drawn in opposite directions, only
the doughnut shape between them is inside, according to the rule; the
doughnut hole is outside.

> **8.5.3.3.3 Even-Odd Rule**

An alternative to the nonzero winding number rule is the *even-odd
rule*. This rule determines whether a point is inside a path by drawing
a ray from that point in any direction and simply counting the number of
path segments that cross the ray, regardless of direction. If this
number is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point is outside. This
yields the same results as the nonzero winding number rule for paths
with simple shapes, but produces different results for more complex
shapes.

Figure 19 shows the effects of applying the even-odd rule to complex
paths. For the five-pointed star, the rule considers the triangular
points to be inside the path, but not the pentagon in the centre. For
the two concentric circles, only the doughnut shape between the two
circles is considered inside, regardless of the directions in which the
circles are drawn.

**8.5.4 Clipping Path Operators**

The graphics state shall contain a *current clipping path* that limits
the regions of the page affected by painting operators. The closed
subpaths of this path shall define the area that can be painted. Marks
falling inside this area shall be applied to the page; those falling
outside it shall not be. Sub-clause 8.5.3.3, \"Filling\" discusses
precisely what shall be considered to be inside a path.

In the context of the transparent imaging model *(PDF 1.4)*, the current
clipping path constrains an object's shape (see 11.2, \"Overview of
Transparency\"). The effective shape is the intersection of the object's
intrinsic shape with the clipping path; the source shape value shall be
0.0 outside this intersection. Similarly, the shape of a transparency
group (defined as the union of the shapes of its constituent objects)
shall be influenced both by the clipping path in effect when each of the
objects is painted and by the one in effect at the time the group's
results are painted onto its backdrop.

The initial clipping path shall include the entire page. A clipping path
operator (**W** or **W\***, shown in Table 61) may appear after the last
path construction operator and before the path-painting operator that
terminates a path object. Although the clipping path operator appears
before the painting operator, it shall not alter the clipping path at
the point where it appears. Rather, it shall modify the effect of the
succeeding painting operator. *After* the path has been painted, the
clipping path in the graphics state shall be set to the intersection of
the current clipping path and the newly constructed path.

> **Table 61 -- Clipping Path Operators**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Operands**   **Operator**   **Description**
  -------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------
  ---            **W**          Modify the current clipping path by
                                intersecting it with the current path,
                                using the nonzero winding number rule to
                                determine which regions lie inside the
                                clipping path.

  ---            **W\***        Modify the current clipping path by
                                intersecting it with the current path,
                                using the even-odd rule to determine which
                                regions lie inside the clipping path.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 In addition to path objects, text objects may also be used for
clipping; see 9.3.6, \"Text Rendering Mode\".

The **n** operator (see Table 60) is a no-op path-painting operator; it
shall cause no marks to be placed on the page, but can be used with a
clipping path operator to establish a new clipping path. That is, after
a path has been constructed, the sequence W n shall intersect that path
with the current clipping path and shall establish a new clipping path.

NOTE 2 There is no way to enlarge the current clipping path or to set a
new clipping path without reference to the current one. However, since
the clipping path is part of the graphics state, its effect can be
localized to specific graphics objects by enclosing the modification of
the clipping path and the painting of those objects between a pair of
**q** and **Q** operators (see 8.4.2, \"Graphics State Stack\").
Execution of the **Q** operator causes the clipping path to revert to
the value that was saved by the **q** operator before the clipping path
was modified.

### 8.6 Colour Spaces

**8.6.1 General**

PDF includes facilities for specifying the colours of graphics objects
to be painted on the current page. The colour facilities are divided
into two parts:

- *Colour specification*. A conforming writer may specify abstract
  colours in a device-independent way. Colours may be described in any
  of a variety of colour systems, or *colour spaces*. Some colour spaces
  are related to device colour representation (grayscale, *RGB*,
  *CMYK*), others to human visual perception (CIEbased). Certain special
  features are also modelled as colour spaces: patterns, colour mapping,
  separations, and high-fidelity and multitone colour.

- *Colour rendering*. A conforming reader shall reproduce colours on the
  raster output device by a multiplestep process that includes some
  combination of colour conversion, gamma correction, halftoning, and
  scan conversion. Some aspects of this process use information that is
  specified in PDF. However, unlike the facilities for colour
  specification, the colour-rendering facilities are device-dependent
  and should not be included in a page description.

Figure 20 and Figure 21 illustrate the division between PDF's
(device-independent) colour specification and (device-dependent)
colour-rendering facilities. This sub-clause describes the colour
specification features, covering everything that PDF documents need to
specify colours. The facilities for controlling colour rendering are
described in clause 10, \"Rendering\"; a conforming writer should use
these facilities only to configure or calibrate an output device or to
achieve special device-dependent effects.

**8.6.2 Colour Values**

As described in 8.5.3, \"Path-Painting Operators\", marks placed on the
page by operators such as **f** and **S** shall have a colour that is
determined by the *current colour* parameter of the graphics state. A
colour value consists of one or more *colour components*, which are
usually numbers. A gray level shall be specified by a single number
ranging from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white). Full colour values may be
specified in any of several ways; a common method uses three numeric
values to specify red, green, and blue components.

Colour values shall be interpreted according to the *current colour
space*, another parameter of the graphics state. A PDF content stream
first selects a colour space by invoking the **CS** operator (for the
stroking colour) or the **cs** operator (for the nonstroking colour). It
then selects colour values within that colour space with the **SC**
operator (stroking) or the **sc** operator (nonstroking). There are also
convenience operators---**G**, **g**, **RG**, **rg**, **K**, and
**k**---that select both a colour space and a colour value within it in
a single step. Table 74 lists all the coloursetting operators.

Sampled images (see 8.9, \"Images\") specify the colour values of
individual samples with respect to a colour space designated by the
image object itself. While these values are independent of the current
colour space and colour parameters in the graphics state, all later
stages of colour processing shall treat them in exactly the same way as
colour values specified with the **SC** or **sc** operator.

**8.6.3 Colour Space Families**

Colour spaces are classified into *colour space families*. Spaces within
a family share the same general characteristics; they shall be
distinguished by parameter values supplied at the time the space is
specified. The families fall into three broad categories:

- *Device colour spaces* directly specify colours or shades of gray that
  the output device shall produce. They provide a variety of colour
  specification methods, including grayscale, *RGB* (red-green-blue),
  and *CMYK* (cyan-magenta-yellow-black), corresponding to the colour
  space families **DeviceGray**, **DeviceRGB**, and **DeviceCMYK**.
  Since each of these families consists of just a single colour space
  with no parameters, they may be referred to as the **DeviceGray**,
  **DeviceRGB**, and **DeviceCMYK** colour spaces.

- *CIE-based colour spaces* shall be based on an international standard
  for colour specification created by the Commission Internationale de
  l'Éclairage (International Commission on Illumination). These spaces
  specify colours in a way that is independent of the characteristics of
  any particular output device. Colour space families in this category
  include **CalGray**, **CalRGB**, **Lab**, and **ICCBased**. Individual
  colour spaces within these families shall be specified by means of
  dictionaries containing the parameter values needed to define the
  space.

- *Special colour spaces* add features or properties to an underlying
  colour space. They include facilities for patterns, colour mapping,
  separations, and high-fidelity and multitone colour. The corresponding
  colour space families are **Pattern**, **Indexed**, **Separation**,
  and **DeviceN**. Individual colour spaces within these families shall
  be specified by means of additional parameters.

Table 62 summarizes the colour space families in PDF.

> **Figure 20 -- Colour Specification**
>
> **Figure 21 -- Colour Rendering**

A colour space shall be defined by an array object whose first element
is a name object identifying the colour space family. The remaining
array elements, if any, are parameters that further characterize the
colour space; their number and types vary according to the particular
family. For families that do not require parameters, the colour space
may be specified simply by the family name itself instead of an array.

A colour space shall be specified in one of two ways:

- Within a content stream, the **CS** or **cs** operator establishes the
  current colour space parameter in the graphics state. The operand
  shall always be name object, which either identifies one of the colour
  spaces that need no additional parameters (**DeviceGray**,
  **DeviceRGB**, **DeviceCMYK**, or some cases of **Pattern**) or shall
  be used as a key in the **ColorSpace** subdictionary of the current
  resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, \"Resource Dictionaries\"). In the
  latter case, the value of the dictionary entry in turn shall be a
  colour space array or name. A colour space array shall never be inline
  within a content stream.

- Outside a content stream, certain objects, such as image XObjects,
  shall specify a colour space as an explicit parameter, often
  associated with the key **ColorSpace**. In this case, the colour space
  array or name shall always be defined directly as a PDF object, not by
  an entry in the **ColorSpace** resource subdictionary. This convention
  also applies when colour spaces are defined in terms of other colour
  spaces.

The following operators shall set the current colour space and current
colour parameters in the graphics state:

- **CS** shall set the stroking colour space; **cs** shall set the
  nonstroking colour space.

- **SC** and **SCN** shall set the stroking colour; **sc** and **scn**
  shall set the nonstroking colour. Depending on the colour space, these
  operators shall have one or more operands, each specifying one
  component of the colour value.

- **G**, **RG**, and **K** shall set the stroking colour space
  implicitly and the stroking colour as specified by the operands;
  **g**, **rg**, and **k** do the same for the nonstroking colour space
  and colour.

**8.6.4 Device Colour Spaces**

**8.6.4.1 General**

The device colour spaces enable a page description to specify colour
values that are directly related to their representation on an output
device. Colour values in these spaces map directly (or by simple
conversions) to the application of device colorants, such as quantities
of ink or intensities of display phosphors. This enables a conforming
writer to control colours precisely for a particular device, but the
results might not be consistent from one device to another.

Output devices form colours either by adding light sources together or
by subtracting light from an illuminating source. Computer displays and
film recorders typically add colours; printing inks typically subtract
them. These two ways of forming colours give rise to two complementary
methods of colour specification, called *additive* and *subtractive*
colour (see Figure L.1 in Annex L). The most widely used forms of these
two types of colour specification are known as *RGB* and *CMYK*,
respectively, for the names of the primary colours on which they are
based. They correspond to the following device colour spaces:

- **DeviceGray** controls the intensity of achromatic light, on a scale
  from black to white.

- **DeviceRGB** controls the intensities of red, green, and blue light,
  the three additive primary colours used in displays.

- **DeviceCMYK** controls the concentrations of cyan, magenta, yellow,
  and black inks, the four subtractive process colours used in printing.

NOTE Although the notion of explicit colour spaces is a PDF 1.1 feature,
the operators for specifying colours in the device colour
spaces---**G**, **g**, **RG**, **rg**, **K**, and **k**---are available
in all versions of PDF. Beginning with PDF 1.2, colours specified in
device colour spaces can optionally be remapped systematically into
other colour spaces; see 8.6.5.6, \"Default Colour Spaces\".

In the transparent imaging model *(PDF 1.4)*, the use of device colour
spaces is subject to special treatment within a transparency group whose
group colour space is CIE-based (see 11.4, \"Transparency Groups\" and
11.6.6, \"Transparency Group XObjects\"). In particular, the device
colour space operators should be used only if device colour spaces have
been remapped to CIE-based spaces by means of the default colour space
mechanism. Otherwise, the results are implementation-dependent and
unpredictable.

**8.6.4.2 DeviceGray Colour Space**

Black, white, and intermediate shades of gray are special cases of full
colour. A grayscale value shall be represented by a single number in the
range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 corresponds to black, 1.0 to white, and
intermediate values to different gray levels.

EXAMPLE This example shows alternative ways to select the **DeviceGray**
colour space and a specific gray level within that space for stroking
operations.

> /DeviceGray CS % Set DeviceGray colour space *gray* SC % Set gray
> level *gray* G % Set both in one operation

The **CS** and **SC** operators shall select the current stroking colour
space and current stroking colour separately; **G** shall set them in
combination. (The **cs**, **sc**, and **g** operators shall perform the
same functions for nonstroking operations.) Setting either current
colour space to **DeviceGray** shall initialize the corresponding
current colour to 0.0.

**8.6.4.3 DeviceRGB Colour Space**

Colours in the **DeviceRGB** colour space shall be specified according
to the additive *RGB* (red-green-blue) colour model, in which colour
values shall be defined by three components representing the intensities
of the additive primary colorants red, green, and blue. Each component
shall be specified by a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 shall
denote the complete absence of a primary component and 1.0 shall denote
maximum intensity.

EXAMPLE This example shows alternative ways to select the **DeviceRGB**
colour space and a specific colour within that space for stroking
operations.

+----------------------+----------------+
| /DeviceRGB CS        | \% Set         |
|                      | DeviceRGB      |
|                      | colour space   |
+:=====================+:===============+
| *red* *green* *blue* | > \% Set       |
| SC                   | > colour       |
+----------------------+----------------+
| *red* *green* *blue* | > \% Set both  |
| RG                   | > in one       |
|                      | > operation    |
+----------------------+----------------+

The **CS** and **SC** operators shall select the current stroking colour
space and current stroking colour separately; **RG** shall set them in
combination. The **cs**, **sc**, and **rg** operators shall perform the
same functions for nonstroking operations. Setting either current colour
space to **DeviceRGB** shall initialize the red, green, and blue
components of the corresponding current colour to 0.0.

**8.6.4.4 DeviceCMYK Colour Space**

The **DeviceCMYK** colour space allows colours to be specified according
to the subtractive *CMYK* (cyanmagenta-yellow-black) model typical of
printers and other paper-based output devices. The four components in a
**DeviceCMYK** colour value shall represent the concentrations of these
process colorants. Each component shall be a number in the range 0.0 to
1.0, where 0.0 shall denote the complete absence of a process colorant
and 1.0 shall denote maximum concentration (absorbs as much as possible
of the additive primary).

NOTE As much as the reflective colours (CMYK) decrease reflection with
increased ink values and radiant colours (RGB) increases the intensity
of colours with increased values the values work in an opposite manner.

EXAMPLE The following shows alternative ways to select the
**DeviceCMYK** colour space and a specific colour within that space for
stroking operations.

+----------------------+-----------------+
| /DeviceCMYK CS       | > \% Set        |
|                      | > DeviceCMYK    |
|                      | > colour space  |
+:=====================+:================+
| *cyan* *magenta*     | \% Set colour   |
| *yellow* *black* SC  |                 |
+----------------------+-----------------+
| *cyan magenta yellow | \% Set both in  |
| black K*             | one operation   |
+----------------------+-----------------+

The **CS** and **SC** operators shall select the current stroking colour
space and current stroking colour separately; **K** shall set them in
combination. The **cs**, **sc**, and **k** operators shall perform the
same functions for nonstroking operations. Setting either current colour
space to **DeviceCMYK** shall initialize the cyan, magenta, and yellow
components of the corresponding current colour to 0.0 and the black
component to 1.0.

**8.6.5 CIE-Based Colour Spaces**

**8.6.5.1 General**

Calibrated colour in PDF shall be defined in terms of an international
standard used in the graphic arts, television, and printing industries.
*CIE-based* colour spaces enable a page description to specify colour
values in a way that is related to human visual perception. The goal is
for the same colour specification to produce consistent results on
different output devices, within the limitations of each device; Figure
L.2 in Annex L illustrates the kind of variation in colour reproduction
that can result from the use of uncalibrated colour on different
devices. PDF 1.1 supports three CIE-based colour space families, named
**CalGray**, **CalRGB**, and **Lab**; PDF 1.3 added a fourth, named
**ICCBased**.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 In PDF 1.1, a colour space family named ***CalCMYK*** was
         partially defined, with the expectation that its definition
         would be completed in a future version. However, this
         feature has been deprecated. PDF 1.3 and later versions
         support calibrated four-component colour spaces by means of
         ICC profiles (see 8.6.5.5, \"ICCBased Colour Spaces\"). A
         conforming reader should ignore ***CalCMYK*** colour space
         attributes and render colours specified in this family as
         if they had been specified using ***DeviceCMYK***.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 The details of the CIE colourimetric system and the theory
         on which it is based are beyond the scope of this
         specification; see the Bibliography for sources of further
         information. The semantics of CIE-based colour spaces are
         defined in terms of the relationship between the space's
         components and the tristimulus values *X*, *Y*, and *Z* of
         the CIE 1931 *XYZ* space. The **CalRGB** and **Lab** colour
         spaces *(PDF 1.1)* are special cases of three-component
         CIE-based colour spaces, known as *CIE-based ABC* colour
         spaces. These spaces are defined in terms of a two-stage,
         nonlinear transformation of the CIE 1931 *XYZ* space. The
         formulation of such colour spaces models a simple *zone
         theory* of colour vision, consisting of a nonlinear
         trichromatic first stage combined with a nonlinear
         opponent-colour second stage. This formulation allows
         colours to be digitized with minimum loss of fidelity, an
         important consideration in sampled images.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

Colour values in a CIE-based *ABC* colour space shall have three
components, arbitrarily named *A*, *B*, and *C.* The first stage shall
transform these components by first forcing their values to a specified
range, then applying *decoding functions*, and then multiplying the
results by a 3-by-3 matrix, producing three intermediate components
arbitrarily named *L*, *M*, and *N*. The second stage shall transform
these intermediate components in a similar fashion, producing the final
*X*, *Y*, and *Z* components of the CIE 1931 *XYZ* space (see Figure
22).

> **Figure 22 -- Component Transformations in a CIE-based *ABC* Colour
> Space**

Colour spaces in the CIE-based families shall be defined by an array

> \[ *name* *dictionary* \]

where *name* is the name of the family and *dictionary* is a dictionary
containing parameters that further characterize the space. The entries
in this dictionary have specific interpretations that depend on the
colour space; some entries are required and some are optional. See the
sub-clauses on specific colour space families for details.

Setting the current stroking or nonstroking colour space to any
CIE-based colour space shall initialize all components of the
corresponding current colour to 0.0 (unless the range of valid values
for a given component does not include 0.0, in which case the nearest
valid value shall be substituted.)

NOTE 3 The model and terminology used here---*CIE-based ABC* (above) and
*CIE-based A* (below)---are derived from the PostScript language, which
supports these colour space families in their full generality. PDF
supports specific useful cases of CIE-based *ABC* and CIE-based *A*
spaces; most others can be represented as ***ICCBased*** spaces.

**8.6.5.2 CalGray Colour Spaces**

A **CalGray** colour space *(PDF 1.1)* is a special case of a
single-component CIE-based colour space, known as a *CIE-based A* colour
space. This type of space is the one-dimensional (and usually
achromatic) analog of CIEbased *ABC* spaces. Colour values in a
CIE-based *A* space shall have a single component, arbitrarily named
*A.* Figure 23 illustrates the transformations of the *A* component to
*X*, *Y*, and *Z* components of the CIE 1931 *XYZ* space.

> **Figure 23 -- Component Transformations in a CIE-based *A* Colour
> Space**

A **CalGray** colour space shall be a CIE-based *A* colour space with
only one transformation stage instead of two. In this type of space, *A*
represents the gray component of a calibrated gray space. This component
shall be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The decoding function (denoted by
"Decode *A*" in Figure 23) is a gamma function whose coefficient shall
be specified by the **Gamma** entry in the colour space dictionary (see
Table 63). The transformation matrix denoted by "Matrix *A*" in the
figure is derived from the dictionary's **WhitePoint** entry, as
described below. Since there is no second transformation stage, "Decode
*LMN*" and "Matrix *LMN*" shall be implicitly taken to be identity
transformations.

white point to obtain the *L*, *M*, and *N* components of the
intermediate representation. Since there is no second stage, the *L*,

**8.6.5.3 CalRGB Colour Spaces**

A **CalRGB** colour space is a CIE-based *ABC* colour space with only
one transformation stage instead of two. In this type of space, *A*,
*B*, and *C* represent calibrated red, green, and blue colour values.
These three colour components shall be in the range 0.0 to 1.0;
component values falling outside that range shall be adjusted to the
nearest valid value without error indication. The decoding functions
(denoted by "Decode *ABC*" in Figure 22) are gamma functions whose
coefficients shall be specified by the **Gamma** entry in the colour
space dictionary (see Table 64). The transformation matrix denoted by
"Matrix *ABC*" in Figure 22 shall be defined by the dictionary's
**Matrix** entry. Since there is no second transformation stage, "Decode
*LMN*" and "Matrix *LMN*" shall be implicitly taken to be identity
transformations.

  **WhitePoint**   array      *(Required)* An array of three numbers \[
                              *X~W~* *Y~W~* *Z~W~* \] specifying the
                              tristimulus value, in the CIE 1931 *XYZ*
                              space, of the diffuse white point; see
                              below for further discussion. The numbers
                              *X~W~* and *Z~W~* shall be positive, and
                              *Y~W~* shall be equal to 1.0.

                              space, of the diffuse black point; see
                              below for further discussion. All three of
                              these numbers shall be non-negative.
                              Default value: \[ 0.0 0.0 0.0 \].

  **Gamma**        array      *(Optional)* An array of three numbers \[
                              *G~R~* *G~G~* *G~B~* \] specifying the
                              gamma for the red, green, and blue *(A*,
                              *B*, and *C)* components of the colour
                              space. Default value: \[ 1.0 1.0 1.0 \].

  **Matrix**       array      *(Optional)* An array of nine numbers \[
                              *X~A~* *Y~A~* *Z~A~* *X~B~* *Y**~B~***
                              *Z~B~* *X~C~* *Y~C~* *Z~C~*\] specifying
                              the linear interpretation of the decoded
                              *A*, *B*, and *C* components of the colour
                              space with respect to the final *XYZ*
                              representation. Default value: the identity
                              matrix \[ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 \].
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The **WhitePoint** and **BlackPoint** entries in the colour space
dictionary shall control the overall effect of the CIE-based gamut
mapping function described in sub-clause 10.2, \"CIE-Based Colour to
Device Colour\". Typically, the colours specified by **WhitePoint** and
**BlackPoint** shall be mapped to the nearly lightest and nearly darkest
achromatic colours that the output device is capable of rendering in a
way that preserves colour appearance and visual contrast.

**WhitePoint** represents the diffuse achromatic highlight, not a
specular highlight. Specular highlights, achromatic or otherwise, are
often reproduced lighter than the diffuse highlight. **BlackPoint**
represents the diffuse achromatic shadow; its value is limited by the
dynamic range of the input device. In images produced by a photographic
system, the values of **WhitePoint** and **BlackPoint** vary with
exposure, system response, and artistic intent; hence, their values are
image-dependent.

The transformation defined by the **Gamma** and **Matrix** entries in
the **CalRGB** colour space dictionary shall be

GR GG G

X.  = L = X~A~ × A + X~B~ × B + X~C~ × C

GR GG G

Y.  = M = Y~A~ × A + Y~B~ × B + Y~C~ × C

GR GG GB

Z.  = N = Z~A~ × A + Z~B~ × B + Z~C~ × C

The *A*, *B*, and *C* components shall first be decoded individually by
the gamma functions. The results shall be treated as a three-element
vector and multiplied by **Matrix** (a 3-by-3 matrix) to obtain the *L*,
*M*, and *N* components of the intermediate representation. Since there
is no second stage, these shall also be the *X*, *Y*, and *Z* components
of the final representation.

EXAMPLE The following shows an example of a **CalRGB** colour space for
the CCIR XA/11--recommended D65 white point with 1.8 gammas and Sony
Trinitron phosphor chromaticities.

The parameters of a **CalRGB** colour space may be specified in terms of
the CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates (*x~R~* , *y~R~* ), (*x~G~*,
*y~G~* ), (*x~B~* , *y~B~* ) of the red, green, and blue phosphors,
respectively, and the chromaticity (*x~W~* , *y~W~* ) of the diffuse
white point corresponding to a linear *RGB* value (*R*, *G*, *B*), where
*R*, *G*, and *B* should all equal 1.0. The standard CIE notation uses
lowercase letters to specify chromaticity coordinates and uppercase
letters to specify tristimulus values. Given this information,
**Matrix** and **WhitePoint** shall be calculated as follows:

> z = yW × ((xG -- xB) × yR -- (xR -- xB) × yG + (xR -- xG) × yB
>
> y

**8.6.5.4 Lab Colour Spaces**

A **Lab** colour space is a CIE-based *ABC* colour space with two
transformation stages (see Figure 22). In this type of space, *A*, *B*,
and *C* represent the *L*\*, *a*\*, and *b*\* components of a CIE 1976
*L*\**a*\**b*\* space. The range of the first *(L*\**)* component shall
be 0 to 100; the ranges of the second and third *(a*\* and *b*\**)*
components shall be defined by the **Range** entry in the colour space
dictionary (see Table 65).

Figure L.3 in Annex L illustrates the coordinates of a typical **Lab**
colour space; Figure L.4 in Annex L compares the gamuts (ranges of
representable colours) for *L\*a\*b\**, *RGB*, and *CMYK* spaces.

*L*\**a*\**b*\* space to *XYZ* space (denoted by "Decode *ABC*," "Matrix
*ABC*," "Decode *LMN*," and "Matrix *LMN*" in Figure 22). Instead, these

**8.6.5.5 ICCBased Colour Spaces**

**ICCBased** colour spaces *(PDF 1.3)* shall be based on a
cross-platform *colour profile* as defined by the International Color
Consortium (ICC) (see, "Bibliography"). Unlike the **CalGray**,
**CalRGB**, and **Lab** colour spaces, which are characterized by
entries in the colour space dictionary, an **ICCBased** colour space
shall be characterized by a sequence of bytes in a standard format.
Details of the profile format can be found in the ICC specification
(see, "Bibliography").

An **ICCBased** colour space shall be an array:

> \[ /ICCBased stream \]

The stream shall contain the ICC profile. Besides the usual entries
common to all streams (see Table 5), the profile stream shall have the
additional entries listed in Table 66.

> Dictionary**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**   **Value**
  --------- ---------- -------------------------------------------
  **N**     integer    *(Required)* The number of colour
                       components in the colour space described by
                       the ICC profile data. This number shall
                       match the number of components actually in
                       the ICC profile. **N** shall be 1, 3, or 4.

| **Alternate** | array or | *(Optional)* An alternate colour space    |
|               |          | that shall be used in case the one        |

|               |          | supported. Non-conforming readers may use |
|               |          | this colour space. The alternate space    |
|               |          | may be any valid colour space (except a   |
|               |          | **Pattern** colour space) that has the    |
|               |          | number of components specified by **N**.  |

|               |          | shall be used is **DeviceGray**,          |
|               |          | **DeviceRGB**, or **DeviceCMYK**,         |
|               |          | depending on whether the value of **N**   |
|               |          | is 1, 3, or 4, respectively.              |

The ICC specification is an evolving standard. Table 67 shows the

Conforming writers and readers should follow these guidelines:

- A conforming reader shall support ICC.1:2004:10 as required by PDF
  1.7, which will enable it to properly render all embedded ICC profiles
  regardless of the PDF version.

- A conforming reader shall always process an embedded ICC profile
  according to the corresponding version of the PDF being processed as
  shown in Table 67 above; it shall not substitute the Alternate colour
  space in these cases.

- A conforming writer should use ICC 1:2004-10 profiles. It may embed
  profiles conforming to a later ICC version. The conforming reader
  should process such profiles according to Table 67; if that is not
  possible, it shall substitute the Alternate colour space.

- Conforming writers shall only use the profile types shown in Table 68
  for specifying calibrated colour spaces for colouring graphic objects.
  Each of the indicated fields shall have one of the values listed for
  that field in the second column of the table. Profiles shall satisfy
  *both* the criteria shown in the table. The terminology is taken from
  the ICC specifications.

NOTE 1 XYZ and 16-bit L\*a\*b\* profiles are not listed.

The terminology used in PDF colour spaces and ICC colour profiles is
similar, but sometimes the same terms are used with different meanings.
The default value for each component in an **ICCBased** colour space is
0. The range of each colour component is a function of the colour space
specified by the profile and is indicated in the ICC specification. The
ranges for several ICC colour spaces are shown in Table 69.

|                 | > *b*\*: \[ −128 127 \]          |
+-----------------+----------------------------------+

Since the **ICCBased** colour space is being used as a source colour
space, only the "to CIE" profile information (*AToB* in ICC terminology)
shall be used; the "from CIE" (*BToA*) information shall be ignored when
present. An ICC profile may also specify a *rendering intent*, but a
conforming reader shall ignore this information; the rendering intent
shall be specified in PDF by a separate parameter (see 8.6.5.8,
\"Rendering Intents\").

The requirements stated above apply to an ***ICCBased*** colour space
that is used to specify the source colours of graphics objects. When
such a space is used as the blending colour space for a transparency
group in the transparent imaging model (see 11.3.4, \"Blending Colour
Space\"; 11.4, \"Transparency Groups\"; and 11.6.6, \"Transparency Group
XObjects\"), it shall have both "to CIE" *(AToB)* and "from CIE"
*(BToA)* information. This is because the group colour space shall be
used as both the destination for objects being painted within the group
and the source for the group's results. ICC profiles shall also be used
in specifying *output intents* for matching the colour characteristics
of a PDF document with those of a target output device or production
environment. When used in this context, they shall be subject to still
other constraints on the "to CIE" and "from CIE" information; see
14.11.5, \"Output Intents\", for details.

The representations of **ICCBased** colour spaces are less compact than
**CalGray**, **CalRGB**, and **Lab**, but can represent a wider range of
colour spaces.

NOTE 2 One particular colour space is the "standard *RGB*" or *sRGB*,
defined in the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) document
*Color Measurement and Management in Multimedia Systems and Equipment*
(see, "Bibliography"). In PDF, the *sRGB* colour space can only be
expressed as an **ICCBased** space, although it can be approximated by a
**CalRGB** space.

EXAMPLE The following shows an **ICCBased** colour space for a typical
three-component RGB space. The profile's data has been encoded in
hexadecimal representation for readability; in actual practice, a
lossless decompression filter such as **FlateDecode** should be used.

**8.6.5.6 Default Colour Spaces**

Colours that are specified in a device colour space (**DeviceGray**,
**DeviceRGB**, or **DeviceCMYK**) are devicedependent. By setting
*default colour spaces (PDF 1.1)*, a conforming writer can request that
such colours shall be systematically transformed *(remapped)* into
device-independent CIE-based colour spaces. This capability can be
useful in a variety of circumstances:

- A document originally intended for one output device is redirected to
  a different device.

- A document is intended to be compatible with non-compliant readers and
  thus cannot specify CIE-based colours directly.

- Colour corrections or rendering intents need to be applied to device
  colours (see 8.6.5.8, \"Rendering Intents\").

A colour space is selected for painting each graphics object. This is
either the current colour space parameter in the graphics state or a
colour space given as an entry in an image XObject, inline image, or
shading dictionary. Regardless of how the colour space is specified, it
shall be subject to remapping as described below.

When a device colour space is selected, the **ColorSpace** subdictionary
of the current resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, \"Resource
Dictionaries\") is checked for the presence of an entry designating a
corresponding default colour space (**DefaultGray**, **DefaultRGB**, or
**DefaultCMYK**, corresponding to **DeviceGray**, **DeviceRGB**, or
**DeviceCMYK**, respectively). If such an entry is present, its value
shall be used as the colour space for the operation currently being
performed.

Colour values in the original device colour space shall be passed
unchanged to the default colour space, which shall have the same number
of components as the original space. The default colour space should be
chosen to be compatible with the original, taking into account the
components' ranges and whether the components are additive or
subtractive. If a colour value lies outside the range of the default
colour space, it shall be adjusted to the nearest valid value.

Any colour space other than a **Lab**, **Indexed**, or **Pattern**
colour space may be used as a default colour space and it should be
compatible with the original device colour space as described above.

If the selected space is a special colour space based on an underlying
device colour space, the default colour space shall be used in place of
the underlying space. This shall apply to the following colour spaces:

- The underlying colour space of a **Pattern** colour space

- The base colour space of an **Indexed** colour space

- The alternate colour space of a **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour
  space (but only if the alternate colour space is actually selected)

See 8.6.6, \"Special Colour Spaces\", for details on these colour
spaces.

There is no conversion of colour values, such as a tint transformation,
when using the default colour space. Colour values that are within the
range of the device colour space might not be within the range of the
default colour space (particularly if the default is an **ICCBased**
colour space). In this case, the nearest values within the range of the
default space are used. For this reason, a **Lab** colour space shall
not be used as the **DefaultRGB** colour space.

**8.6.5.7 Implicit Conversion of CIE-Based Colour Spaces**

In cases where a source colour space accurately represents the
particular output device being used, a conforming reader should avoid
converting the component colour values but use the source values
directly as output values. This avoids any unwanted computational error
and in the case of 4 component colour spaces avoids the conversion from
4 components to 3 and back to 4, a process that loses critical colour
information.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 In workflows in which PDF documents are intended for
         rendering on a specific target output device (such as a
         printing press with particular inks and media), it is often
         useful to specify the source colours for some or all of a
         document's objects in a CIE-based colour space that matches
         the calibration of the intended device. The resulting
         document, although tailored to the specific characteristics
         of the target device, remains deviceindependent and will
         produce reasonable results if retargeted to a different
         output device. However, the expectation is that if the
         document is printed on the intended target device, source
         colours that have been specified in a colour space matching
         the calibration of the device will pass through unchanged,
         without conversion to and from the intermediate CIE 1931
         *XYZ* space as depicted in Figure 22.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 In particular, when colours intended for a *CMYK* output
         device are specified in an **ICCBased** colour space using
         a matching *CMYK* printing profile, converting such colours
         from four components to three and back is unnecessary and
         results in a loss of fidelity in the black component. In
         such cases, a conforming reader may provide the ability for
         the user to specify a particular calibration to use for
         printing, proofing, or previewing. This calibration is then
         considered to be that of the native colour space of the
         intended output device (typically **DeviceCMYK**), and
         colours expressed in a CIE-based source colour space
         matching it can be treated as if they were specified
         directly in the device's native colour space.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 3 The conditions under which such implicit conversion is done
cannot be specified in PDF, since nothing in PDF describes the
calibration of the output device (although an output intent dictionary,
if present, may suggest such a calibration; see 14.11.5, \"Output
Intents\"). The conversion is completely hidden by the conforming reader
and plays no part in the interpretation of PDF colour spaces.

When this type of implicit conversion is done, all of the semantics of
the device colour space shall also apply, even though they do not apply
to CIE-based spaces in general. In particular:

- The nonzero overprint mode (see 8.6.7, \"Overprint Control\") shall
  determine the interpretation of colour component values in the space.

- If the space is used as the blending colour space for a transparency
  group in the transparent imaging model (see 11.3.4, \"Blending Colour
  Space\"; 11.4, \"Transparency Groups\"; and 11.6.6, \"Transparency
  Group XObjects\"), components of the space, such as **Cyan**, may be
  selected in a **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space used within
  the group (see 8.6.6.4, \"Separation Colour Spaces\" and 8.6.6.5,
  \"DeviceN Colour Spaces\").

- Likewise, any uses of device colour spaces for objects within such a
  transparency group have well-defined conversions to the group colour
  space.

NOTE 4 A source colour space can be specified directly (for example,
with an ***ICCBased*** colour space) or indirectly using the default
colour space mechanism (for example, ***DefaultCMYK***; see 8.6.5.6,
\"Default Colour Spaces\"). The implicit conversion of a CIE-based
colour space to a device space should not depend on whether the CIEbased
space is specified directly or indirectly.

**8.6.5.8 Rendering Intents**

Although CIE-based colour specifications are theoretically
device-independent, they are subject to practical limitations in the
colour reproduction capabilities of the output device. Such limitations
may sometimes require compromises to be made among various properties of
a colour specification when rendering colours for a given device.
Specifying a *rendering intent* *(PDF 1.1)* allows a conforming writer
to set priorities regarding which of these properties to preserve and
which to sacrifice.

EXAMPLE The conforming writer might request that colours falling within
the output device's gamut (the range of colours it can reproduce) be
rendered exactly while sacrificing the accuracy of out-of-gamut colours,
or that a scanned image such as a photograph be rendered in a
perceptually pleasing manner at the cost of strict colourimetric
accuracy.

Rendering intents shall be specified with the **ri** operator (see
8.4.4, \"Graphics State Operators\"), the **RI** entry in a graphics
state parameter dictionary (see 8.4.5, \"Graphics State Parameter
Dictionaries\"), or with the **Intent** entry in image dictionaries (see
8.9.5, \"Image Dictionaries\"). The value shall be a name identifying
the rendering intent. Table 70 lists the standard rendering intents that
shall be recognized. Figure L.5 in Annex L illustrates their effects.
These intents have been chosen to correspond to those defined by the
International Color Consortium (ICC), an industry organization that has
developed standards for device-independent colour. If a conforming
reader does not recognize the specified name, it shall use the
**RelativeColorimetric** intent by default.

NOTE Note, however, that the exact set of rendering intents supported
may vary from one output device to another; a particular device may not
support all possible intents or may support additional ones beyond those
listed in the table.

See 11.7.5, \"Rendering Parameters and Transparency\", and in particular
11.7.5.3, \"Rendering Intent and Colour Conversions\", for further
discussion of the role of rendering intents in the transparent imaging
model.

**8.6.6 Special Colour Spaces**

**8.6.6.1 General**

Special colour spaces add features or properties to an underlying colour
space. There are four special colour space families: **Pattern**,
**Indexed**, **Separation**, and **DeviceN**.

**8.6.6.2 Pattern Colour Spaces**

A **Pattern** colour space *(PDF 1.2)* specifies that an area is to be
painted with a *pattern* rather than a single colour. The pattern shall
be either a *tiling pattern* (type 1) or a *shading pattern* (type 2).
8.7, \"Patterns\", discusses patterns in detail.

**8.6.6.3 Indexed Colour Spaces**

An **Indexed** colour space specifies that an area is to be painted
using a *colour map* or *colour table* of arbitrary colours in some
other space. A conforming reader shall treat each sample value as an
index into the colour table and shall use the colour value it finds
there. This technique can considerably reduce the amount of data
required to represent a sampled image.

An **Indexed** colour space shall be defined by a four-element array:

> \[ /Indexed *base* *hival* *lookup* \]

The first element shall be the colour space family name **Indexed**. The
remaining elements shall be parameters that an **Indexed** colour space
requires; their meanings are discussed below. Setting the current
stroking or nonstroking colour space to an **Indexed** colour space
shall initialize the corresponding current colour to 0.

The *base* parameter shall be an array or name that identifies the *base
colour space* in which the values in the colour table are to be
interpreted. It shall be any device or CIE-based colour space or *(PDF
1.3)* a **Separation** or **DeviceN** space, but shall not be a
**Pattern** space or another **Indexed** space. If the base colour space
is **DeviceRGB**, the values in the colour table shall be interpreted as
red, green, and blue components; if the base colour space is a CIE-based
*ABC* space such as a **CalRGB** or **Lab** space, the values shall be
interpreted as *A*, *B*, and *C* components.

The *hival* parameter shall be an integer that specifies the maximum
valid index value. The colour table shall be indexed by integers in the
range 0 to *hival*. *hival* shall be no greater than 255, which is the
integer required to index a table with 8-bit index values.

The colour table shall be defined by the *lookup* parameter, which may
be either a stream or *(PDF 1.2)* a byte string. It shall provide the
mapping between index values and the corresponding colours in the base
colour space.

The colour table data shall be *m* ¥ (*hival* + 1) bytes long, where *m*
is the number of colour components in the base colour space. Each byte
shall be an unsigned integer in the range 0 to 255 that shall be scaled
to the range of the corresponding colour component in the base colour
space; that is, 0 corresponds to the minimum value in the range for that
component, and 255 corresponds to the maximum.

The colour components for each entry in the table shall appear
consecutively in the string or stream.

Although an **Indexed** colour space is useful mainly for images, index
values can also be used with the colour selection operators **SC**,
**SCN**, **sc**, and **scn**.

EXAMPLE 2 The following selects the same colour as does an image sample
value of 123.

> 123 sc

The index value should be an integer in the range 0 to *hival*. If the
value is a real number, it shall be rounded to the nearest integer; if
it is outside the range 0 to *hival*, it shall be adjusted to the
nearest value within that range.

**8.6.6.4 Separation Colour Spaces**

A **Separation** colour space *(PDF 1.2)* provides a means for
specifying the use of additional colorants or for isolating the control
of individual colour components of a device colour space for a
subtractive device. When such a space is the current colour space, the
current colour shall be a single-component value, called a *tint*, that
controls the application of the given colorant or colour components
only.

+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE 1 | Colour output devices produce full colour by combining    |
|        | *primary* or *process colorants* in varying amounts. On   |
|        | an additive colour device such as a display, the primary  |
|        | colorants consist of red, green, and blue phosphors; on a |
|        | subtractive device such as a printer, they typically      |
|        | consist of cyan, magenta, yellow, and sometimes black     |
|        | inks. In addition, some devices can apply special         |
|        | colorants, often called *spot colorants*, to produce      |
|        | effects that cannot be achieved with the standard process |
|        | colorants alone. Examples include metallic and            |
|        | fluorescent colours and special textures.                 |
+:=======+===========================================================+
| NOTE 2 | When printing a page, most devices produce a single       |
|        | *composite* page on which all process colorants (and spot |
|        | colorants, if any) are combined. However, some devices,   |
|        | such as imagesetters, produce a separate, monochromatic   |
|        | rendition of the page, called a *separation*, for each    |
|        | colorant. When the separations are later combined---on a  |
|        | printing press, for example---and the proper inks or      |
|        | other colorants are applied to them, the result is a      |
|        | full-colour page.                                         |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| > NOTE | > The term *separation* is often misused as a synonym for |
| > 3    | > an individual device colorant. In the context of this   |
|        | > discussion, a printing system that produces separations |
|        | > generates a separate piece of physical medium           |
|        | > (generally film) for each colorant. It is these pieces  |
|        | > of physical medium that are correctly referred to as    |
|        | > separations. A particular colorant properly constitutes |
|        | > a separation only if the device is generating physical  |
|        | > separations, one of which corresponds to the given      |
|        | > colorant. The ***Separation*** colour space is so named |
|        | > for historical reasons, but it has evolved to the       |
|        | > broader purpose of controlling the application of       |
|        | > individual colorants in general, regardless of whether  |
|        | > they are actually realized as physical separations.     |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE 4 | > The operation of a ***Separation*** colour space itself |
|        | > is independent of the characteristics of any particular |
|        | > output device. Depending on the device, the space may   |
|        | > or may not correspond to a true, physical separation or |
|        | > to an actual colorant. For example, a ***Separation***  |
|        | > colour space could be used to control the application   |
|        | > of a single process colorant (such as cyan) on a        |
|        | > composite device that does not produce physical         |
|        | > separations, or could represent a colour (such as       |
|        | > orange) for which no specific colorant exists on the    |
|        | > device. A ***Separation*** colour space provides        |
|        | > consistent, predictable behaviour, even on devices that |
|        | > cannot directly generate the requested colour.          |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

A **Separation** colour space is defined as follows:

> \[ /Separation *name* *alternateSpace* *tintTransform* \]

It shall be a four-element array whose first element shall be the colour
space family name **Separation**. The remaining elements are parameters
that a **Separation** colour space requires; their meanings are
discussed below.

A colour value in a **Separation** colour space shall consist of a
single tint component in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The value 0.0 shall
represent the minimum amount of colorant that can be applied; 1.0 shall
represent the maximum. Tints shall always be treated as *subtractive*
colours, even if the device produces output for the designated component
by an additive method. Thus, a tint value of 0.0 denotes the lightest
colour that can be achieved with the given colorant, and 1.0 is the
darkest. The initial value for both the stroking and nonstroking colour
in the graphics state shall be 1.0. The **SCN** and **scn** operators
respectively shall set the current stroking and nonstroking colour to a
tint value. A sampled image with single-component samples may also be
used as a source of tint values.

NOTE 5 This convention is the same as for **DeviceCMYK** colour
components but opposite to the one for **DeviceGray** and **DeviceRGB**.

The *name* parameter is a name object that shall specify the name of the
colorant that this **Separation** colour space is intended to represent
(or one of the special names **All** or **None**; see below). Such
colorant names are arbitrary, and there may be any number of them,
subject to implementation limits.

The special colorant name **All** shall refer collectively to all
colorants available on an output device, including those for the
standard process colorants. When a **Separation** space with this
colorant name is the current colour space, painting operators shall
apply tint values to all available colorants at once.

NOTE 6 This is useful for purposes such as painting registration targets
in the same place on every separation. Such marks are typically painted
as the last step in composing a page to ensure that they are not
overwritten by subsequent painting operations.

The special colorant name **None** shall not produce any visible output.
Painting operations in a **Separation** space with this colorant name
shall have no effect on the current page.

A conforming reader shall support **Separation** colour spaces with the
colorant names **All** and **None** on all devices, even if the devices
are not capable of supporting any others. When processing **Separation**
spaces with either of these colorant names conforming readers shall
ignore the *alternateSpace* and *tintTransform* parameters (discussed
below), although valid values shall still be provided.

At the moment the colour space is set to a **Separation** space, the
conforming reader shall determine whether the device has an available
colorant corresponding to the name of the requested space. If so, the
conforming reader shall ignore the *alternateSpace* and *tintTransform*
parameters; subsequent painting operations within the space shall apply
the designated colorant directly, according to the tint values supplied.

The preceding paragraph applies only to subtractive output devices such
as printers and imagesetters. For an additive device such as a computer
display, a **Separation** colour space never applies a process colorant
directly; it always reverts to the alternate colour space as described
below. This is because the model of applying process colorants
independently does not work as intended on an additive device.

EXAMPLE 1 Painting tints of the ***Red*** component on a white
background produces a result that varies from white to cyan.

This exception applies only to colorants for additive devices, not to
the specific names **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**. In contrast, a
printer might have a (subtractive) ink named **Red**, which should work
as a **Separation** colour space just the same as any other supported
colorant.

If the colorant name associated with a **Separation** colour space does
not correspond to a colorant available on the device, the conforming
reader shall arrange for subsequent painting operations to be performed
in an *alternate colour space.* The intended colours may be approximated
by colours in a device or CIE-based colour space, which shall then be
rendered with the usual primary or process colorants:

- The *alternateSpace* parameter shall be an array or name object that
  identifies the alternate colour space, which may be any device or
  CIE-based colour space but may not be another special colour space
  (**Pattern**, **Indexed**, **Separation**, or **DeviceN**).

- The *tintTransform* parameter shall be a function (see 7.10,
  \"Functions\"). During subsequent painting operations, a conforming
  reader calls this function to transform a tint value into colour
  component values in the alternate colour space. The function shall be
  called with the tint value and shall return the corresponding colour
  component values. That is, the number of components and the
  interpretation of their values shall depend on the alternate colour
  space.

NOTE 7 Painting in the alternate colour space may produce a good
approximation of the intended colour when only opaque objects are
painted. However, it does not correctly represent the interactions
between an object and its backdrop when the object is painted with
transparency or when overprinting (see 8.6.7, \"Overprint Control\") is
enabled.

EXAMPLE 2 The following illustrates the specification of a
**Separation** colour space (object 5) that is intended to produce a
colour named LogoGreen. If the output device has no colorant
corresponding to this colour, **DeviceCMYK** is used as the alternate
colour space, and the tint transformation function (object 12) maps tint
values linearly into shades of a CMYK colour value approximating the
LogoGreen colour.

See 11.7.3, \"Spot Colours and Transparency\", for further discussion of
the role of **Separation** colour spaces in the transparent imaging
model.

**8.6.6.5 DeviceN Colour Spaces**

**DeviceN** colour spaces *(PDF 1.3)* may contain an arbitrary number of
colour components.

NOTE 1 They provide greater flexibility than is possible with standard
device colour spaces such as **DeviceCMYK** or with individual
**Separation** colour spaces.

EXAMPLE 1 It is possible to create a **DeviceN** colour space consisting
of only the cyan, magenta, and yellow colour components, with the black
component excluded.

NOTE 2 **DeviceN** colour spaces are used in applications such as these:

> High-fidelity colour is the use of more than the standard CMYK process
> colorants to produce an extended gamut, or range of colours. A popular
> example is the PANTONE Hexachrome system, which uses six colorants:
> the usual cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, plus orange and green.
>
> Multitone colour systems use a single-component image to specify
> multiple colour components. In a duotone, for example, a
> single-component image can be used to specify both the black component
> and a spot colour component. The tone reproduction is generally
> different for the different components. For example, the black
> component might be painted with the exact sample data from the
> single-component image; the spot colour component might be generated
> as a nonlinear function of the image data in a manner that emphasizes
> the shadows. Figure L.6 in Annex L shows an example that uses black
> and magenta colour components. In Figure L.7 in Annex L, a
> single-component grayscale image is used to generate a quadtone result
> that uses four colorants: black and three PANTONE spot colours. See
> EXAMPLE 5 in this sub-clause for the code used to generate this image.

**DeviceN** shall be used to represent colour spaces containing multiple
components that correspond to colorants of some target device. As with
**Separation** colour spaces, conforming readers shall be able to
approximate the colorants if they are not available on the current
output device, such as a display. To accomplish this, the colour space
definition provides a tint transformation function that shall be used to
convert all the components to an alternate colour space.

PDF 1.6 extended the meaning of **DeviceN** to include colour spaces
that are referred to as ***NChannel*** *colour spaces*. Such colour
spaces may contain an arbitrary number of spot and process components,
which may or may not correspond to specific device colorants (the
process components shall be from a single process colour space). They
provide information about each component that allows conforming readers
more flexibility in converting colours. These colour spaces shall be
identified by a value of **NChannel** for the **Subtype** entry of the
attributes dictionary (see Table 71). A value of **DeviceN** for the
**Subtype** entry, or no value, shall mean that only the previous
features shall be supported. Conforming readers that do not support PDF
1.6 shall treat these colour spaces as normal **DeviceN** colour spaces
and shall use the tint transformation function as appropriate.
Conforming writers using the **NChannel** features should follow certain
guidelines, as noted throughout this sub-clause, to achieve good
backward compatibility.

EXAMPLE 2 They may use their own blending algorithms for on-screen
viewing and composite printing, rather than being required to use a
specified tint transformation function.

**DeviceN** colour spaces shall be defined in a similar way to
**Separation** colour spaces---in fact, a **Separation** colour space
can be defined as a **DeviceN** colour space with only one component.

A **DeviceN** colour space shall be specified as follows:

\[ /DeviceN *names* *alternateSpace* *tintTransform* \] or

> \[ /DeviceN *names* *alternateSpace* *tintTransform* *attributes* \]

It is a four- or five-element array whose first element shall be the
colour space family name **DeviceN**. The remaining elements shall be
parameters that a **DeviceN** colour space requires.

The *names* parameter shall be an array of name objects specifying the
individual colour components. The length of the array shall determine
the number of components in the **DeviceN** colour space, which is
subject to an implementation limit; see Annex C.The component names
shall all be different from one another, except for the name **None**,
which may be repeated as described later in this sub-clause. The special
name **All**, used by **Separation** colour spaces, shall not be used.

Colour values shall be tint components in the range 0.0 to 1.0:

- For **DeviceN** colour spaces that do not have a subtype of
  **NChannel**, 0.0 shall represent the minimum amount of colorant; 1.0
  shall represent the maximum. Tints shall always be treated as
  subtractive colours, even if the device produces output for the
  designated component by an additive method. Thus, a tint value of 0.0
  shall denote the lightest colour that can be achieved with the given
  colorant, and 1.0 the darkest.

NOTE 3 This convention is the same one as for **DeviceCMYK** colour
components but opposite to the one for **DeviceGray** and **DeviceRGB**.

- For **NChannel** colour spaces, values for additive process colours
  (such as *RGB*) shall be specified in their natural form, where 1.0
  shall represent maximum intensity of colour.

When this space is set to the current colour space (using the **CS** or
**cs** operators), each component shall be given an initial value of
1.0. The **SCN** and **scn** operators respectively shall set the
current stroking and nonstroking colour. Operand values supplied to
**SCN** or **scn** shall be interpreted as colour component values in
the order in which the colours are given in the *names* array, as are
the values in a sampled image that uses a **DeviceN** colour space.

The *alternateSpace* parameter shall be an array or name object that can
be any device or CIE-based colour space but shall not be another special
colour space (**Pattern**, **Indexed**, **Separation**, or **DeviceN**).
When the colour space is set to a **DeviceN** space, if any of the
component names in the colour space do not correspond to a colorant
available on the device, the conforming reader shall perform subsequent
painting operations in the alternate colour space specified by this
parameter.

For **NChannel** colour spaces, the components shall be evaluated
individually; that is, only the ones not present on the output device
shall use the alternate colour space.

The *tintTransform* parameter shall specify a function (see 7.10,
\"Functions\") that is used to transform the tint values into the
alternate colour space. It shall be called with *n* tint values and
returns *m* colour component values, where *n* is the number of
components needed to specify a colour in the **DeviceN** colour space
and *m* is the number required by the alternate colour space.

NOTE 4 Painting in the alternate colour space may produce a good
approximation of the intended colour when only opaque objects are
painted. However, it does not correctly represent the interactions
between an object and its backdrop when the object is painted with
transparency or when overprinting (see 8.6.7, \"Overprint Control\") is
enabled.

The colour component name **None**, which may be present only for
**DeviceN** colour spaces that do not have the **NChannel** subtype,
indicates that the corresponding colour component shall never be painted
on the page, as in a **Separation** colour space for the **None**
colorant. When a **DeviceN** colour space is painting the named device
colorants directly, colour components corresponding to **None**
colorants shall be discarded. However, when the **DeviceN** colour space
reverts to its alternate colour space, those components shall be passed
to the tint transformation function, which may use them as desired.

A **DeviceN** colour space whose component colorant names are all
**None** shall always discard its output, just the same as a
**Separation** colour space for **None**; it shall never revert to the
alternate colour space. Reversion shall occur only if at least one
colour component (other than **None**) is specified and is not available
on the device.

The optional *attributes* parameter shall be a dictionary (see Table 71)
containing additional information about the components of colour space
that conforming readers may use. Conforming readers need not use the
*alternateSpace* and *tintTransform* parameters, and may instead use
custom blending algorithms, along with other information provided in the
attributes dictionary if present. (If the value of the **Subtype** entry
in the attributes dictionary is **NChannel**, such information shall be
present.) However, *alternateSpace* and *tintTransform* shall always be
provided for conforming readers that want to use them or do not support
PDF 1.6.

A value of **NChannel** for the **Subtype** entry indicates that some of
the other entries in this dictionary are required rather than optional.
The **Colorants** entry specifies a *colorants dictionary* that contains
entries for all the spot colorants in the colour space; they shall be
defined using individual **Separation** colour spaces. The **Process**
entry specifies a *process dictionary* (see Table 72) that identifies
the process colour space that is used by this colour space and the names
of its components. It shall be present if **Subtype** is **NChannel**
and the colour space has process colour components. An **NChannel**
colour space shall contain components from at most one process colour
space.

For colour spaces that have a value of **NChannel** for the **Subtype**
entry in the attributes dictionary (see Table 71), the following
restrictions apply to process colours:

- There may be colour components from at most one process colour space,
  which may be any device or CIE-based colour space.

- For a non-*CMYK* colour space, the names of the process components
  shall appear sequentially in the *names* array, in the normal colour
  space order (for example, **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**). However,
  the names in the *names* array need not match the actual colour space
  names (for example, a **Red** component need not be named **Red**).The
  mapping of names is specified in the process dictionary (see Table 72
  and discussion below), which shall be present.

- Definitions for process colorants should not appear in the colorants
  dictionary. Any such definition shall be ignored if the colorant is
  also present in the process dictionary. Any component not specified in
  the process dictionary shall be considered to be a spot colorant.

- For a *CMYK* colour space, a subset of the components may be present,
  and they may appear in any order in the *names* array. The reserved
  names **Cyan**, **Magenta**, **Yellow**, and **Black** shall always be
  considered to be process colours, which do not necessarily correspond
  to the colorants of a specific device; they need not have entries in
  the process dictionary.

- The values associated with the process components shall be stored in
  their natural form (that is, subtractive colour values for *CMYK* and
  additive colour values for *RGB*), since they shall be interpreted
  directly as process values by consumers making use of the process
  dictionary. (For additive colour spaces, this is the reverse of how
  colour values are specified for **DeviceN**, as described above in the
  discussion of the *names* parameter.)

The **MixingHints** entry in the attributes dictionary specifies a
*mixing hints dictionary* (see Table 73) that provides information about
the characteristics of colorants that may be used in blending
calculations when the actual colorants are not available on the target
device. Conforming readers need not use this information.

|             |            | loss) represents the amount by which a |
|             |            | printer's halftone dots change as the  |
|             |            | ink spreads and is absorbed by paper.  |

|             |            | **DeviceN** instance and need not list |
|             |            | all colorants. An entry with a key of  |
|             |            | **Default** shall specify a function   |
|             |            | to be used by all colorants for which  |
|             |            | a dot gain function is not explicitly  |
|             |            | specified.                             |

|             |            | Conforming readers may ignore values   |
|             |            | in this dictionary when other sources  |
|             |            | of dot gain information are available, |
|             |            | such as ICC profiles associated with   |
|             |            | the process colour space or tint       |
|             |            | transformation functions associated    |
|             |            | with individual colorants.             |
+-------------+------------+----------------------------------------+

Each entry in the mixing hints dictionary refers to colorant names,
which include spot colorants referenced by the **Colorants** dictionary.
Under some circumstances, they may also refer to one or more individual
process components called **Cyan**, **Magenta**, **Yellow**, or
**Black** when **DeviceCMYK** is specified as the process colour space
in the process dictionary. However, applications shall ignore these
process component entries if they can obtain the information from an ICC
profile.

NOTE 5 The mixing hints subdictionaries (as well as the colorants
dictionary) may specify colorants that are not used in any given
instance of a ***DeviceN*** colour space. This allows them to be
referenced from multiple ***DeviceN*** colour spaces, which can produce
smaller file sizes as well as consistent colour definitions across
instances.

For consistency of colour, conforming readers should follow these
guidelines:

- The conforming reader shall apply either the specified tint
  transformation function or invoke the same alternative blending
  algorithm for all ***DeviceN*** instances in the document.

NOTE 6 When the tint transformation function is used, the burden is on
the conforming writer to guarantee that the individual function
definitions chosen for all ***DeviceN*** instances produce similar
colour appearances throughout the document.

- Blending algorithms should produce a similar appearance for colours
  when they are used as separation colours or as a component of a
  **DeviceN** colour space.

EXAMPLE 3 This example shows a **DeviceN** colour space consisting of
three colour components named **Orange**, **Green**, and **None**. In
this example, the **DeviceN** colour space, object 30, has an attributes
dictionary whose **Colorants** entry is an indirect reference to object
45 (which might also be referenced by attributes dictionaries of other
**DeviceN** colour spaces). *tintTransform1*, whose definition is not
shown, maps three colour components (tints of the colorants **Orange**,
**Green**, and **None**) to four colour components in the alternate
colour space, **DeviceCMYK**. *tintTransform2* maps a single colour
component (an orange tint) to four components in **DeviceCMYK**.
Likewise, *tintTransform3* maps a green tint to **DeviceCMYK**, and
*tintTransform4* maps a tint of PANTONE 131 to **DeviceCMYK**.

**8.6.6.6 Multitone Examples**

NOTE 1 The following examples illustrate various interesting and useful
special cases of the use of **Indexed** and **DeviceN** colour spaces in
combination to produce multitone colours.

NOTE 2 EXAMPLE 1 and EXAMPLE 2 in this sub-clause illustrate the use of
**DeviceN** to create duotone colour spaces.

+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| EXAMPLE | > In this example, an **Indexed** colour space maps index       |
| 1       | > values in the range 0 to 255 to a duotone **DeviceN** space   |
|         | > in cyan and black. In effect, the index values are treated as |
|         | > if they were tints of the duotone space, which are then       |
|         | > mapped into tints of the two underlying colorants. Only the   |
|         | > beginning of the lookup table string for the **Indexed**      |
|         | > colour space is shown; the full table would contain 256       |
|         | > two-byte entries, each specifying a tint value for cyan and   |
|         | > black, for a total of 512 bytes. If the alternate colour      |
|         | > space of the **DeviceN** space is selected, the tint          |
|         | > transformation function (object 15 in the example) maps the   |
|         | > two tint components for cyan and black to the four components |
|         | > for a **DeviceCMYK** colour space by supplying                |
|         +---------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|         | > zero values for the other two |                               |
|         | > components.                   |                               |

| NOTE 3  | Given a formula for converting any combination of black and     |
|         | gold tints to calibrated *RGB*, a 2-in, 3-out type 4            |
|         | (PostScript calculator) function could be used for the tint     |
|         | transformation. Alternatively, a type 0 (sampled) function      |
|         | could be used, but this would require a large number of sample  |
|         | points to represent the function acc[u]{.underline}rately; for  |
|         | example, sampling each input variable for 256 tint values       |
|         | between 0.0 and 1.0 would require 256 ^2^ = 65,536 samples. But |
|         | since the **DeviceN** colour space is being used as the base of |
|         | an **Indexed** colour space, there are actually only 256        |
|         | possible combinations of black and gold tint values.            |

| > NOTE 4   | In EXAMPLE 3 in this sub-clause, each entry in the lookup table has *five*         |
|            | components: two for the black and gold colorants and three more (specified as      |

|            | colorants are available on the output device, the **None** components are ignored; |
|            | if black and gold are not available, the tint transformation function is used to   |

NOTE 5 As in the preceding examples, an **Indexed** colour space based
on a **DeviceN** space is used to paint the grayscale image shown on the
left in the plate with four colorants: black and three PANTONE spot
colours. The alternate colour space is a simple calibrated *RGB*. Thus,
the **DeviceN** colour space has seven components: the four desired
colorants plus the three components of the alternate space. The example
shows the image XObject (see 8.9.5, \"Image Dictionaries\") representing
the quadtone image, followed by the colour space used to interpret the
image data.

**8.6.7 Overprint Control**

The graphics state contains an *overprint parameter*, controlled by the
**OP** and **op** entries in a graphics state parameter dictionary.
Overprint control is useful mainly on devices that produce true physical
separations, but it is available on some composite devices as well.
Although the operation of this parameter is device-dependent, it is
described here rather than in the sub-clause on colour rendering,
because it pertains to an aspect of painting in device colour spaces
that is important to many applications.

Any painting operation marks some specific set of device colorants,
depending on the colour space in which the painting takes place. In a
**Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space, the colorants to be marked
shall be specified explicitly; in a device or CIE-based colour space,
they shall be implied by the process colour model of the output device
(see clause 10, \"Rendering\"). The overprint parameter is a boolean
flag that determines how painting operations affect colorants other than
those explicitly or implicitly specified by the current colour space.

If the overprint parameter is **false** (the default value), painting a
colour in any colour space shall cause the corresponding areas of
unspecified colorants to be erased (painted with a tint value of 0.0).
The effect is that the colour at any position on the page is whatever
was painted there last, which is consistent with the normal painting
behaviour of the opaque imaging model.

If the overprint parameter is **true** and the output device supports
overprinting, erasing actions shall not be performed; anything
previously painted in other colorants is left undisturbed. Consequently,
the colour at a given position on the page may be a combined result of
several painting operations in different colorants. The effect produced
by such overprinting is device-dependent and is not defined here.

NOTE 1 Not all devices support overprinting. Furthermore, many
PostScript printers support it only when separations are being produced,
and not for composite output.

If overprinting is not supported, the value of the overprint parameter
shall be ignored.

An additional graphics state parameter, the *overprint mode (PDF 1.3)*,
shall affect the interpretation of a tint value of 0.0 for a colour
component in a **DeviceCMYK** colour space when overprinting is enabled.
This parameter is controlled by the **OPM** entry in a graphics state
parameter dictionary; it shall have an effect only when the overprint
parameter is **true**, as described above.

When colours are specified in a **DeviceCMYK** colour space and the
native colour space of the output device is also **DeviceCMYK**, each of
the source colour components controls the corresponding device colorant
directly. Ordinarily, each source colour component value replaces the
value previously painted for the corresponding device colorant, no
matter what the new value is; this is the default behaviour, specified
by overprint mode 0.

When the overprint mode is 1 (also called *nonzero overprint mode*), a
tint value of 0.0 for a source colour component shall leave the
corresponding component of the previously painted colour unchanged. The
effect is equivalent to painting in a **DeviceN** colour space that
includes only those components whose values are nonzero.

EXAMPLE If the overprint parameter is **true** and the overprint mode is
1, the operation

> 0\. 2 0. 3 0.0 1.0 k
>
> is equivalent to
>
> 0\. 2 0. 3 1.0 scn
>
> in the colour space shown in this example.

Nonzero overprint mode shall apply only to painting operations that use
the current colour in the graphics state when the current colour space
is **DeviceCMYK** (or is implicitly converted to **DeviceCMYK**; see
8.6.5.7, \"Implicit Conversion of CIE-Based Colour Spaces\"). It shall
not apply to the painting of images or to any colours that are the
result of a computation, such as those in a shading pattern or
conversions from some other colour space. It also shall not apply if the
device's native colour space is not **DeviceCMYK**; in that case, source
colours shall be converted to the device's native colour space, and all
components participate in the conversion, whatever their values.

NOTE 2 This is shown explicitly in the alternate colour space and tint
transformation function of the **DeviceN** colour space (see EXAMPLE 3
in 8.6.6, \"Special Colour Spaces\").

See 11.7.4, \"Overprinting and Transparency\", for further discussion of
the role of overprinting in the transparent imaging model.

**8.6.8 Colour Operators**

Table 74 lists the PDF operators that control colour spaces and colour
values. Also colour-related is the graphics state operator **ri**,
listed in Table 57 and discussed under 8.6.5.8, \"Rendering Intents\".
Colour operators may appear at the page description level or inside text
objects (see Figure 9 in Annex L).

+--------------+----------------+----------------------------------------+

Invoking operators that specify colours or other colour-related
parameters in the graphics state is restricted in certain circumstances.
This restriction occurs when defining graphical figures whose colours
shall be specified separately each time they are used. Specifically, the
restriction applies in these circumstances:

- In any glyph description that uses the **d1** operator (see 9.6.5,
  \"Type 3 Fonts\")

- In the content stream of an uncoloured tiling pattern (see 8.7.3.3,
  \"Uncoloured Tiling Patterns\")

In these circumstances, the following actions cause an error:

- Invoking any of the following operators:

+-------------+-------------+----------+
| **CS**      | **scn**     | **K**    |
+:============+:============+:=========+
| **cs**      | **G**       | **k**    |

+-------------+-------------+----------+
| > **sc**    | **rg**      |          |
+-------------+-------------+----------+

- Invoking the **gs** operator with any of the following entries in the
  graphics state parameter dictionary:

  --------------------------------------------
  **TR**            **BG**          **UCR**
  -------- ------------------------ ----------
  **TR2            **BG2**          **UCR2**
  HT**                              

  --------------------------------------------

- Painting an image. However, painting an *image mask* (see 8.9.6.2,
  \"Stencil Masking\") shall be permitted because it does not specify
  colours; instead, it designates places where the current colour shall
  be painted.

###  8.7 Patterns

**8.7.1 General**

Patterns come in two varieties:

- *Tiling patterns* consist of a small graphical figure (called a
  *pattern cell*) that is replicated at fixed horizontal and vertical
  intervals to fill the area to be painted. The graphics objects to use
  for tiling shall be described by a content stream.

- *Shading patterns* define a *gradient fill* that produces a smooth
  transition between colours across the area. The colour to use shall be
  specified as a function of position using any of a variety of methods.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > When operators such as **S** (stroke), **f** (fill),    |
| 1    | > and **Tj** (show text) paint an area of the page with   |
|      | > the current colour, they ordinarily apply a single      |
|      | > colour that covers the area uniformly. However, it is   |
|      | > also possible to apply "paint" that consists of a       |
|      | > repeating graphical figure or a smoothly varying colour |
|      | > gradient instead of a simple colour. Such a repeating   |
|      | > figure or smooth gradient is called a *pattern.*        |
|      | > Patterns are quite general, and have many uses; for     |
|      | > example, they can be used to create various graphical   |
|      | > textures, such as weaves, brick walls, sunbursts, and   |
|      | > similar geometrical and chromatic effects.              |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | Older techniques such as defining a pattern by using      |
| 2    | character glyphs in a special font and painting them      |
|      | repeatedly with the ***Tj*** operator should not be used. |
|      | Another technique, defining patterns as halftone screens, |
|      | should not be used because the effects produced are       |
|      | device-dependent.                                         |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Patterns shall be specified in a special family of colour spaces named
**Pattern**. These spaces shall use *pattern objects* as the equivalent
of colour values instead of the numeric component values used with other
spaces. A pattern object shall be a dictionary or a stream, depending on
the type of pattern; the term *pattern dictionary* is used generically
throughout this sub-clause to refer to either a dictionary object or the
dictionary portion of a stream object. (Those pattern objects that are
streams are specifically identified as such in the descriptions of
particular pattern types; unless otherwise stated, they are understood
to be simple dictionaries instead.) This sub-clause describes
**Pattern** colour spaces and the specification of colour values within
them.

NOTE 3 See 8.6, \"Colour Spaces\", for information about colour spaces
and colour values in general and 11.6.7, \"Patterns and Transparency\",
for further discussion of the treatment of patterns in the transparent
imaging model.

**8.7.2 General Properties of Patterns**

A pattern dictionary contains descriptive information defining the
appearance and properties of a pattern. All pattern dictionaries shall
contain an entry named **PatternType**, whose value identifies the kind
of pattern the dictionary describes: type 1 for a tiling pattern or type
2 for a shading pattern. The remaining contents of the dictionary depend
on the pattern type and are detailed in the sub-clauses on individual
pattern types.

All patterns shall be treated as colours; a **Pattern** colour space
shall be established with the **CS** or **cs** operator just like other
colour spaces, and a particular pattern shall be installed as the
current colour with the **SCN** or **scn** operator (see Table 74).

A pattern's appearance is described with respect to its own internal
coordinate system. Every pattern has a *pattern matrix*, a
transformation matrix that maps the pattern's internal coordinate system
to the default coordinate system of the pattern's *parent content
stream* (the content stream in which the pattern is defined as a
resource). The concatenation of the pattern matrix with that of the
parent content stream establishes the *pattern coordinate space*, within
which all graphics objects in the pattern shall be interpreted.

NOTE 1 If a pattern is used on a page, the pattern appears in the
**Pattern** subdictionary of that page's resource dictionary, and the
pattern matrix maps pattern space to the default (initial) coordinate
space of the page. Changes to the page's transformation matrix that
occur within the page's content stream, such as rotation and scaling,
have no effect on the pattern; it maintains its original relationship to
the page no matter where on the page it is used. Similarly, if a pattern
is used within a form XObject (see 8.10, \"Form XObjects\"), the pattern
matrix maps pattern space to the form's default user space (that is, the
form coordinate space at the time the form is painted with the **Do**
operator). A pattern may be used within another pattern; the inner
pattern's matrix defines its relationship to the pattern space of the
outer pattern.

NOTE 2 PostScript allows a pattern to be defined in one context but used
in another. For example, a pattern might be defined on a page (that is,
its pattern matrix maps the pattern coordinate space to the user space
of the page) but be used in a form on that page, so that its
relationship to the page is independent of each individual placement of
the form. PDF does not support this feature; in PDF, all patterns shall
be local to the context in which they are defined.

**8.7.3 Tiling Patterns**

**8.7.3.1 General**

A *tiling pattern* consists of a small graphical figure called a
*pattern cell*. Painting with the pattern replicates the cell at fixed
horizontal and vertical intervals to fill an area. The effect is as if
the figure were painted on the surface of a clear glass tile, identical
copies of which were then laid down in an array covering the area and
trimmed to its boundaries. This process is called *tiling* the area.

The pattern cell can include graphical elements such as filled areas,
text, and sampled images. Its shape need not be rectangular, and the
spacing of tiles can differ from the dimensions of the cell itself. When
performing painting operations such as **S** (stroke) or **f** (fill),
the conforming reader shall paint the cell on the current page as many
times as necessary to fill an area. The order in which individual tiles
(instances of the cell) are painted is unspecified and unpredictable;
figures on adjacent tiles should not overlap.

The appearance of the pattern cell shall be defined by a content stream
containing the painting operators needed to paint one instance of the
cell. Besides the usual entries common to all streams (see Table 5),
this stream's dictionary may contain the additional entries listed in
Table 75.

| **PaintType**  | integer    | *(Required)* A code that determines   |
|                |            | how the colour of the pattern cell    |
|                |            | shall be specified:                   |
|                |            |                                       |
|                |            | a)  *Coloured tiling pattern*. The    |
|                |            |     pattern's content stream shall    |
|                |            |     specify the colours used to paint |
|                |            |     the pattern cell. When the        |
|                |            |     content stream begins execution,  |
|                |            |     the current colour is the one     |
|                |            |     that was initially in effect in   |
|                |            |     the pattern's parent content      |
|                |            |     stream. This is similar to the    |
|                |            |     definition of the pattern matrix; |
|                |            |     see 8.7.2, \"General Properties   |
|                |            |     of Patterns\".                    |
|                |            |                                       |
|                |            | b)  *Uncoloured tiling pattern*. The  |
|                |            |     pattern's content stream shall    |
|                |            |     not specify any colour            |
|                |            |     information. Instead, the entire  |
|                |            |     pattern cell is painted with a    |
|                |            |     separately specified colour each  |
|                |            |     time the pattern is used.         |
|                |            |     Essentially, the content stream   |
|                |            |     describes a *stencil* through     |
|                |            |     which the current colour shall be |
|                |            |     poured. The content stream shall  |
|                |            |     not invoke operators that specify |
|                |            |     colours or other colourrelated    |
|                |            |     parameters in the graphics state; |
|                |            |     otherwise, an error occurs (see   |
|                |            |     8.6.8, \"Colour Operators\"). The |
|                |            |     content stream may paint an image |
|                |            |     mask, however, since it does not  |
|                |            |     specify any colour information    |
|                |            |     (see 8.9.6.2, \"Stencil           |

| **TilingType** | integer    | *(Required)* A code that controls     |
|                |            | adjustments to the spacing of tiles   |
|                |            | relative to the device pixel grid:    |
|                |            |                                       |
|                |            | a)  *Constant spacing*. Pattern cells |
|                |            |     shall be spaced                   |
|                |            |     consistently---that is, by a      |
|                |            |     multiple of a device pixel. To    |
|                |            |     achieve this, the conforming      |
|                |            |     reader may need to distort the    |
|                |            |     pattern cell slightly by making   |
|                |            |     small adjustments to **XStep**,   |
|                |            |     **YStep**, and the transformation |
|                |            |     matrix. The amount of distortion  |
|                |            |     shall not exceed 1 device pixel.  |
|                |            |                                       |
|                |            | b)  *No distortion*. The pattern cell |
|                |            |     shall not be distorted, but the   |
|                |            |     spacing between pattern cells may |
|                |            |     vary by as much as 1 device       |
|                |            |     pixel, both horizontally and      |
|                |            |     vertically, when the pattern is   |
|                |            |     painted. This achieves the        |
|                |            |     spacing requested by **XStep**    |
|                |            |     and **YStep** *on average* but    |
|                |            |     not necessarily for each          |
|                |            |     individual pattern cell.          |
|                |            |                                       |
|                |            | c)  *Constant spacing and faster      |
|                |            |     tiling*. Pattern cells shall be   |
|                |            |     spaced consistently as in tiling  |
|                |            |     type 1 but with additional        |
|                |            |     distortion permitted to enable a  |
|                |            |     more efficient implementation.    |
+----------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **BBox**       | rectangle  | *(Required)* An array of four numbers |

|                |            | giving the coordinates of the left,   |
|                |            | bottom, right, and top edges,         |
|                |            | respectively, of the pattern cell's   |
|                |            | bounding box. These boundaries shall  |
|                |            | be used to clip the pattern cell.     |
+----------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **XStep**      | number     | *(Required)* The desired horizontal   |
|                |            | spacing between pattern cells,        |
|                |            | measured in the pattern coordinate    |
|                |            | system.                               |
+----------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **YStep**      | number     | *(Required)* The desired vertical     |
|                |            | spacing between pattern cells,        |
|                |            | measured in the pattern coordinate    |
|                |            | system.                               |
|                |            |                                       |
|                |            | NOTE **XStep** and **YStep** may      |
|                |            | differ from the dimensions of the     |
|                |            | pattern cell implied by the **BBox**  |
|                |            | entry. This allows tiling with        |
|                |            | irregularly shaped figures.           |
|                |            |                                       |
|                |            | **XStep** and **YStep** may be either |
|                |            | positive or negative but shall not be |
|                |            | zero.                                 |
+----------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **Resources**  | dictionary | *(Required)* A resource dictionary    |
|                |            | that shall contain all of the named   |
|                |            | resources required by the pattern's   |
|                |            | content stream (see 7.8.3, \"Resource |
|                |            | Dictionaries\").                      |
+----------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **Matrix**     | array      | *(Optional)* An array of six numbers  |
|                |            | specifying the pattern matrix (see    |
|                |            | 8.7.2, \"General Properties of        |
|                |            | Patterns\"). Default value: the       |
|                |            | identity matrix \[ 1 0 0 1 0 0 \].    |
+----------------+------------+---------------------------------------+

The pattern dictionary's **BBox**, **XStep**, and **YStep** values shall
be interpreted in the pattern coordinate system, and the graphics
objects in the pattern's content stream shall be defined with respect to
that coordinate system. The placement of pattern cells in the tiling is
based on the location of one *key pattern cell*, which is then displaced
by multiples of **XStep** and **YStep** to replicate the pattern. The
origin of the key pattern cell coincides with the origin of the pattern
coordinate system. The phase of the tiling can be controlled by the
translation components of the **Matrix** entry in the pattern
dictionary.

Prior to painting with a tiling pattern, the conforming writer shall
establish the pattern as the current colour in the graphics state.
Subsequent painting operations tile the painted areas with the pattern
cell described by the pattern's content stream. To obtain the pattern
cell, the conforming reader shall perform these steps:

a)  Saves the current graphics state (as if by invoking the **q**
    operator)

b)  Installs the graphics state that was in effect at the beginning of
    the pattern's parent content stream, with the current transformation
    matrix altered by the pattern matrix as described in 8.7.2,
    \"General Properties of Patterns\"

c)  Paints the graphics objects specified in the pattern's content
    stream

d)  Restores the saved graphics state (as if by invoking the **Q**
    operator)

NOTE The pattern's content stream should not set any of the
device-dependent parameters in the graphics state (see Table 53) because
it may result in incorrect output.

**8.7.3.2 Coloured Tiling Patterns**

A *coloured tiling pattern* is a pattern whose colour is self-contained.
In the course of painting the pattern cell, the pattern's content stream
explicitly sets the colour of each graphical element it paints. A single
pattern cell may contain elements that are painted different colours; it
may also contain sampled grayscale or colour images. This type of
pattern is identified by a pattern type of 1 and a paint type of 1 in
the pattern dictionary.

When the current colour space is a **Pattern** space, a coloured tiling
pattern shall be selected as the current colour by supplying its name as
the single operand to the **SCN** or **scn** operator. This name shall
be the key of an entry in the **Pattern** subdictionary of the current
resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, \"Resource Dictionaries\"), whose value
shall be the stream object representing the pattern. Since the pattern
defines its own colour information, no additional operands representing
colour components shall be specified to **SCN** or **scn**.

EXAMPLE 1 If P1 is the name of a pattern resource in the current
resource dictionary, the following code establishes it as the current
nonstroking colour:

> /Pattern cs
>
> /P1 scn

NOTE 1 Subsequent executions of nonstroking painting operators, such as
**f** (fill), **Tj** (show text), or **Do** (paint external object) with
an image mask, use the designated pattern to tile the areas to be
painted.

NOTE 2 The following defines a page (object 5) that paints three circles
and a triangle using a coloured tiling pattern (object 15) over a yellow
background. The pattern consists of the symbols for the four suits of
playing cards

> (spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs), which are character glyphs
> taken from the ZapfDingbats font (see D.6, \"ZapfDingbats Set and
> Encoding\"); the pattern's content stream specifies the colour of each
> glyph. Figure L.8 in Annex L shows the results.

NOTE 3 Several features of EXAMPLE 2 in this sub-clause are noteworthy:

> The three circles and the triangle are painted with the same pattern.
> The pattern cells align, even though the circles and triangle are not
> aligned with respect to the pattern cell. For example, the position of
> the blue diamonds varies relative to the three circles.
>
> The pattern cell does not completely cover the tile: it leaves the
> spaces between the glyphs unpainted. When the tiling pattern is used
> as a colour, the existing background (the yellow rectangle) shows
> through these unpainted areas.

**8.7.3.3 Uncoloured Tiling Patterns**

An *uncoloured tiling pattern* is a pattern that has no inherent colour:
the colour shall be specified separately whenever the pattern is used.
It provides a way to tile different regions of the page with pattern
cells having the same shape but different colours. This type of pattern
shall be identified by a pattern type of 1 and a paint type of 2 in the
pattern dictionary. The pattern's content stream shall not explicitly
specify any colours; it may paint an image mask (see 8.9.6.2, \"Stencil
Masking\") but no other kind of image.

A **Pattern** colour space representing an uncoloured tiling pattern
shall have a parameter: an object identifying the *underlying colour
space* in which the actual colour of the pattern shall be specified. The
underlying colour space shall be given as the second element of the
array that defines the **Pattern** colour space.

EXAMPLE 1 The array

> \[ /Pattern /DeviceRGB \]
>
> defines a **Pattern** colour space with **DeviceRGB** as its
> underlying colour space.

NOTE The underlying colour space cannot be another ***Pattern*** colour
space.

Operands supplied to the **SCN** or **scn** operator in such a colour
space shall include a colour value in the underlying colour space,
specified by one or more numeric colour components, as well as the name
of a pattern object representing an uncoloured tiling pattern.

**8.7.4 Shading Patterns**

**8.7.4.1 General**

*Shading patterns* *(PDF 1.3)* provide a smooth transition between
colours across an area to be painted, independent of the resolution of
any particular output device and without specifying the number of steps
in the colour transition. Patterns of this type shall be described by
pattern dictionaries with a pattern type of 2. Table 76 shows the
contents of this type of dictionary.

+-------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+

The most significant entry is **Shading**, whose value shall be a
*shading object* defining the properties of the shading pattern's
*gradient fill*. This is a complex "paint" that determines the type of
colour transition the shading pattern produces when painted across an
area. A shading object shall be a dictionary or a stream, depending on
the type of shading; the term *shading dictionary* is used generically
throughout this sub-clause to refer to either a dictionary object or the
dictionary portion of a stream object. (Those shading objects that are
streams are specifically identified as such in the descriptions of
particular shading types; unless otherwise stated, they are understood
to be simple dictionaries instead.)

By setting a shading pattern as the current colour in the graphics
state, a PDF content stream may use it with painting operators such as
**f** (fill), **S** (stroke), **Tj** (show text), or **Do** (paint
external object) with an image mask to paint a path, character glyph, or
mask with a smooth colour transition. When a shading is used in this
way, the geometry of the gradient fill is independent of that of the
object being painted.

**8.7.4.2 Shading Operator**

When the area to be painted is a relatively simple shape whose geometry
is the same as that of the gradient fill itself, the **sh** operator may
be used instead of the usual painting operators. **sh** accepts a
shading dictionary as an operand and applies the corresponding gradient
fill directly to current user space. This operator does not require the
creation of a pattern dictionary or a path and works without reference
to the current colour in the graphics state. Table 77 describes the
**sh** operator.

NOTE Patterns defined by type 2 pattern dictionaries do not tile. To
create a tiling pattern containing a gradient fill, invoke the ***sh***
operator from within the content stream of a type 1 (tiling) pattern.

**8.7.4.3 Shading Dictionaries**

A shading dictionary specifies details of a particular gradient fill,
including the type of shading to be used, the geometry of the area to be
shaded, and the geometry of the gradient fill. Various shading types are
available, depending on the value of the dictionary's **ShadingType**
entry:

- Function-based shadings (type 1) define the colour of every point in
  the domain using a mathematical function (not necessarily smooth or
  continuous).

- Axial shadings (type 2) define a colour blend along a line between two
  points, optionally extended beyond the boundary points by continuing
  the boundary colours.

- Radial shadings (type 3) define a blend between two circles,
  optionally extended beyond the boundary circles by continuing the
  boundary colours. This type of shading is commonly used to represent
  threedimensional spheres and cones.

- Free-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes (type 4) define a common
  construct used by many threedimensional applications to represent
  complex coloured and shaded shapes. Vertices are specified in freeform
  geometry.

- Lattice-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes (type 5) are based on the
  same geometrical construct as type 4 but with vertices specified as a
  pseudorectangular lattice.

- Coons patch meshes (type 6) construct a shading from one or more
  colour patches, each bounded by four cubic Bézier curves.

- Tensor-product patch meshes (type 7) are similar to type 6 but with
  additional control points in each patch, affording greater control
  over colour mapping.

NOTE 1 Table 78 shows the entries that all shading dictionaries share in
common; entries specific to particular shading types are described in
the relevant sub-clause.

NOTE 2 The term *target coordinate space*, used in many of the following
descriptions, refers to the coordinate space into which a shading is
painted. For shadings used with a type 2 pattern dictionary, this is the
pattern

> coordinate space, discussed in 8.7.2, \"General Properties of
> Patterns\". For shadings used directly with the ***sh*** operator, it
> is the current user space.

|                 |           | shading functions at a rate           |
|                 |           | determined by the resolution of the   |
|                 |           | output device. Aliasing can occur if  |
|                 |           | the function is not smooth---that is, |

Shading types 4 to 7 shall be defined by a stream containing descriptive
data characterizing the shading's gradient fill. In these cases, the
shading dictionary is also a stream dictionary and may contain any of
the standard entries common to all streams (see Table 5). In particular,
shall include a **Length** entry.

In addition, some shading dictionaries also include a **Function** entry
whose value shall be a function object (dictionary or stream) defining
how colours vary across the area to be shaded. In such cases, the
shading dictionary usually defines the geometry of the shading, and the
function defines the colour transitions across that geometry. The
function is required for some types of shading and optional for others.
Functions are described in detail in 7.10, \"Functions\".

NOTE 3 Discontinuous colour transitions, or those with high spatial
frequency, may exhibit aliasing effects when painted at low effective
resolutions.

**8.7.4.4 Colour Space: Special Considerations**

> **8.7.4.4.1 General**

Conceptually, a shading determines a colour value for each individual
point within the area to be painted. In practice, however, the shading
may actually be used to compute colour values only for some subset of
the points in the target area, with the colours of the intervening
points determined by interpolation between the ones computed. Conforming
readers are free to use this strategy as long as the interpolated colour
values approximate those defined by the shading to within the smoothness
tolerance specified in the graphics state (see 10.6.3, \"Smoothness
Tolerance\"). The **ColorSpace** entry common to all shading
dictionaries not only defines the colour space in which the shading
specifies its colour values but also determines the colour space in
which colour interpolation is performed.

NOTE 1 Some types of shading (4 to 7) perform interpolation on a
parametric value supplied as *input* to the shading's colour function,
as described in the relevant sub-clause. This form of interpolation is
conceptually distinct from the interpolation described here, which
operates on the *output* colour values produced by the colour function
and takes place within the shading's target colour space.

Gradient fills between colours defined by most shadings may be
implemented using a variety of interpolation algorithms, and these
algorithms may be sensitive to the characteristics of the colour space.

NOTE 2 Linear interpolation, for example, may have observably different
results when applied in a **DeviceCMYK** colour space than in a **Lab**
colour space, even if the starting and ending colours are perceptually
identical. The difference arises because the two colour spaces are not
linear relative to each other.

Shadings shall be rendered according to the following rules:

- If **ColorSpace** is a device colour space different from the native
  colour space of the output device, colour values in the shading shall
  be converted to the native colour space using the standard conversion
  formulas described in 10.3, \"Conversions among Device Colour
  Spaces\". To optimize performance, these conversions may take place at
  any time (before or after any interpolation on the colour values in
  the shading). Thus, shadings defined with device colour spaces may
  have colour gradient fills that are less accurate and somewhat
  device-dependent. (This does not apply to axial and radial
  shadings---shading types 2 and 3---because those shading types perform
  gradient fill calculations on a single variable and then convert to
  parametric colours.)

- If **ColorSpace** is a CIE-based colour space, all gradient fill
  calculations shall be performed in that space. Conversion to device
  colours shall occur only after all interpolation calculations have
  been performed. Thus, the colour gradients are device-independent for
  the colours generated at each point.

- If **ColorSpace** is a **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space, a
  colour conversion (to the alternate colour space) occurs only if one
  or more of the specified colorants is not supported by the device. In
  that case, gradient fill calculations shall be performed in the
  designated **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space before
  conversion to the alternate space. Thus, nonlinear tint transformation
  functions shall be accommodated for the best possible representation
  of the shading.

- If **ColorSpace** is an **Indexed** colour space, all colour values
  specified in the shading shall be immediately converted to the base
  colour space. Depending on whether the base colour space is a device
  or CIEbased space, gradient fill calculations shall be performed as
  stated above. Interpolation shall never occur in an **Indexed** colour
  space, which is quantized and therefore inappropriate for calculations
  that assume a continuous range of colours. For similar reasons, an
  **Indexed** colour space shall not be used in any shading whose colour
  values are generated by a function; this rule applies to any shading
  dictionary that contains a **Function** entry.

**8.7.4.5 Shading Types**

> **8.7.4.5.1 General**

In addition to the entries listed in Table 78, all shading dictionaries
have entries specific to the type of shading they represent, as
indicated by the value of their **ShadingType** entry. The following
sub-clauses describe the available shading types and the dictionary
entries specific to each.

> **8.7.4.5.2 Type 1 (Function-Based) Shadings**

In Type 1 (function-based) shadings, the colour at every point in the
domain is defined by a specified mathematical function. The function
need not be smooth or continuous. This type is the most general of the
available shading types and is useful for shadings that cannot be
adequately described with any of the other types. Table 79 shows the
shading dictionary entries specific to this type of shading, in addition
to those common to all shading dictionaries (see Table 78).

This type of shading shall not be used with an ***Indexed*** colour
space.

+--------------+----------+----------------------------------------+

The domain rectangle (**Domain**) establishes an internal coordinate
space for the shading that is independent of the target coordinate space
in which it shall be painted. The colour function(s) (**Function**)
specify the colour of the shading at each point within this domain
rectangle. The transformation matrix (**Matrix**) then maps the domain
rectangle into a corresponding rectangle or parallelogram in the target
coordinate space. Points within the shading's bounding box (**BBox**)
that fall outside this transformed domain rectangle shall be painted
with the shading's background colour (**Background**); if the shading
dictionary has no **Background** entry, such points shall be left
unpainted. If the function is undefined at any point within the declared
domain rectangle, an error may occur, even if the corresponding
transformed point falls outside the shading's bounding box.

> **8.7.4.5.3 Type 2 (Axial) Shadings**

Type 2 (axial) shadings define a colour blend that varies along a linear
axis between two endpoints and extends indefinitely perpendicular to
that axis. The shading may optionally be extended beyond either or both
endpoints by continuing the boundary colours indefinitely. Table 80
shows the shading dictionary entries specific to this type of shading,
in addition to those common to all shading dictionaries (see Table 78).

This type of shading shall not be used with an ***Indexed*** colour
space.

  **Coords**     array      *(Required)* An array of four numbers \[
                            *x*~0~ *y*~0~ *x*~1~ *y*~1~ \] specifying
                            the starting and ending coordinates of
                            the axis, expressed in the shading's
                            target coordinate space.

  **Domain**     array      *(Optional)* An array of two numbers \[
                            *t*~0~ *t*~1~ \] specifying the limiting
                            values of a parametric variable *t.* The
                            variable is considered to vary linearly
                            between these two values as the colour
                            gradient varies between the starting and
                            ending points of the axis. The variable
                            *t* becomes the input argument to the
                            colour function(s). Default value: \[ 0.0
                            1.0 \].

  **Function**   function   *(Required)* A 1-in, *n*-out function or
                            an array of *n* 1-in, 1-out functions
                            (where *n* is the number of colour
                            components in the shading dictionary's
                            colour space). The function(s) shall be
                            called with values of the parametric
                            variable *t* in the domain defined by the
                            **Domain** entry. Each function's domain
                            shall be a superset of that of the
                            shading dictionary. If the value returned
                            by the function for a given colour
                            component is out of range, it shall be
                            adjusted to the nearest valid value.

  **Extend**     array      *(Optional)* An array of two boolean
                            values specifying whether to extend the
                            shading beyond the starting and ending
                            points of the axis, respectively. Default
                            value: \[ **false** **false** \].
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

The colour blend shall be accomplished by linearly mapping each point
(*x*, *y*) along the axis between the endpoints (*x*~0~ , *y*~0~ ) and
(*x*~1~ , *y*~1~ ) to a corresponding point in the domain specified by
the shading dictionary's **Domain** entry. The points (0, 0) and (1, 0)
in the domain correspond respectively to (*x*~0~ , *y*~0~ ) and (*x*~1~
, *y*~1~ ) on the axis. Since all points along a line in domain space
perpendicular to the line from (0, 0) to (1, 0) have the same colour,
only the new value of *x* needs to be computed:

> (x
>
> x′ =
> \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--1
> -- x0) × (x -- x0) + (y1 -- y0) × (y -- y0-)
>
> (x1 -- x0)2 + (y1 -- y0)2

The value of the parametric variable *t* is then determined from *x* ¢
as follows:

- For 0 £ *x* ¢ £ 1, *t* = *t*~0~ + (*t*~1~ - *t*~0~ ) ¥ *x* ¢.

- For *x* ¢ \< 0, if the first element of the **Extend** array is
  **true**, then *t* = *t*~0~ ; otherwise, *t* is undefined and the
  point shall be left unpainted.

- For *x* ¢ \> 1, if the second element of the **Extend** array is
  **true**, then *t* = *t*~1~ ; otherwise, *t* is undefined and the
  point shall be left unpainted.

The resulting value of *t* shall be passed as input to the function(s)
defined by the shading dictionary's **Function** entry, yielding the
component values of the colour with which to paint the point (*x*, *y*).

NOTE Figure L.10 in Annex L shows three examples of the use of an axial
shading to fill a rectangle and display text. The area to be filled
extends beyond the shading's bounding box. The shading is the same in
all three cases, except for the values of the **Background** and
**Extend** entries in the shading dictionary. In the first example, the
shading is not extended at either end and no background colour is
specified; therefore, the shading is clipped to its bounding box at both
ends. The second example still has no background colour specified, but
the shading is extended at both ends; the result is to fill the
remaining portions of the filled area with the colours

> defined at the ends of the shading. In the third example, the shading
> is extended at both ends and a background colour is specified;
> therefore, the background colour is used for the portions of the

> **8.7.4.5.4 Type 3 (Radial) Shadings**

Type 3 (radial) shadings define a colour blend that varies between two
circles. Shadings of this type are commonly used to depict
three-dimensional spheres and cones. Shading dictionaries for this type
of shading contain the entries shown in Table 81, as well as those
common to all shading dictionaries (see Table 78).

This type of shading shall not be used with an ***Indexed*** colour
space.

                            *^y^*~1~ *^r^*~1~ \] specifying the
                            centres and radii of the starting and
                            ending circles, expressed in the
                            shading's target coordinate space. The
                            radii *r*~0~ and *r*~1~ shall both be
                            greater than or equal to 0. If one radius
                            is 0, the corresponding circle shall be
                            treated as a point; if both are 0,
                            nothing shall be painted.

  **Domain**     array      *(Optional)* An array of two numbers \[
                            *t*~0~ *t*~1~ \] specifying the limiting
                            values of a parametric variable *t*. The
                            variable is considered to vary linearly
                            between these two values as the colour
                            gradient varies between the starting and
                            ending circles. The variable *t* becomes
                            the input argument to the colour
                            function(s). Default value: \[ 0.0 1.0
                            \].

  **Function**   function   *(Required)* A 1-in, *n*-out function or
                            an array of *n* 1-in, 1-out functions
                            (where *n* is the number of colour
                            components in the shading dictionary's
                            colour space). The function(s) shall be
                            called with values of the parametric
                            variable *t* in the domain defined by the
                            shading dictionary's **Domain** entry.
                            Each function's domain shall be a
                            superset of that of the shading
                            dictionary. If the value returned by the
                            function for a given colour component is
                            out of range, it shall be adjusted to the
                            nearest valid value.

  **Extend**     array      *(Optional)* An array of two boolean
                            values specifying whether to extend the
                            shading beyond the starting and ending
                            circles, respectively. Default value: \[
                            **false** **false** \].
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

The colour blend is based on a family of *blend circles* interpolated
between the starting and ending circles that shall be defined by the
shading dictionary's **Coords** entry. The blend circles shall be
defined in terms of a subsidiary parametric variable

> s = \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--t -- t0 t1 -- ^t^0

which varies linearly between 0.0 and 1.0 as *t* varies across the
domain from *t*~0~ to *t*~1~ , as specified by the dictionary's
**Domain** entry. The centre and radius of each blend circle shall be
given by the following parametric equations:

> x~c~( )s = x0 + s × (x1 -- x0) y~c~( )s = y0 + s × (y1 -- y0)
>
> r s( ) = r0 + s × (r1 -- r0)

Each value of *s* between 0.0 and 1.0 determines a corresponding value
of *t*, which is passed as the input argument to the function(s) defined
by the shading dictionary's **Function** entry. This yields the
component values of the colour with which to fill the corresponding
blend circle. For values of *s* not lying between 0.0 and

1.0, the boolean elements of the shading dictionary's **Extend** array
determine whether and how the shading is extended. If the first of the
two elements is **true**, the shading shall be extended beyond the
defined starting circle to values of *s* less than 0.0; if the second
element is **true**, the shading shall be extended beyond the defined
ending circle to *s* values greater than 1.0.

NOTE 1 Either of the starting and ending circles may be larger than the
other. If the shading is extended at the smaller end, the family of
blend circles continues as far as that value of *s* for which the radius
of the blend circle *r* (*s*) = 0. If the shading is extended at the
larger end, the blend circles continue as far as that *s* value for
which *r* (*s*) is large enough to encompass the shading's entire
bounding box (**BBox**). Extending the shading can thus cause painting
to extend beyond the areas defined by the two circles themselves. The
two examples in the rightmost column of Figure L.11 in Annex L depict
the results of extending the shading at the smaller and larger ends,
respectively.

Conceptually, all of the blend circles shall be painted in order of
increasing values of *s*, from smallest to largest. Blend circles
extending beyond the starting circle shall be painted in the same colour
defined by the shading dictionary's **Function** entry for the starting
circle (*t* = *t*~0~ , *s* = 0.0). Blend circles extending beyond the
ending circle shall be painted in the colour defined for the ending
circle (*t* = *t*~1~ , *s* = 1.0). The painting is opaque, with the
colour of each circle completely overlaying those preceding it.
Therefore, if a point lies within more than one blend circle, its final
colour shall be that of the last of the enclosing circles to be painted,
corresponding to the greatest value of *s*.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 If one of the starting and ending circles entirely contains
         the other, the shading depicts a sphere, as in Figure L.12
         and Figure L.13 in Annex L. In Figure L.12 in Annex L, the
         inner circle has zero radius; it is the starting circle in
         the figure on the left and the ending circle in the figure
         on the right. Neither shading is extended at either the
         smaller or larger end. In Figure L.13 in Annex L, the inner
         circle in both figures has a nonzero radius and the shading
         is extended at the larger end. In each plate, a background
         colour is specified for the figure on the right but not for
         the figure on the left.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 3 If neither circle contains the other, the shading depicts a
         cone. If the starting circle is larger, the cone appears to
         point out of the page. If the ending circle is larger, the
         cone appears to point into the page (see Figure L.11 in
         Annex L).

EXAMPLE 1 This example paints the leaf-covered branch shown in Figure
L.14 in Annex L. Each leaf is filled with the same radial shading
(object number 5). The colour function (object 10) is a stitching
function (described in 7.10.4, \"Type 3 (Stitching) Functions\") whose
two subfunctions (objects 11 and 12) are both exponential interpolation
functions (see 7.10.3, \"Type 2 (Exponential Interpolation)
Functions\").

> **8.7.4.5.5 Type 4 Shadings (Free-Form Gouraud-Shaded Triangle
> Meshes)**

Type 4 shadings (free-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes) are commonly
used to represent complex coloured and shaded three-dimensional shapes.
The area to be shaded is defined by a path composed entirely of
triangles. The colour at each vertex of the triangles is specified, and
a technique known as *Gouraud interpolation* is used to colour the
interiors. The interpolation functions defining the shading may be
linear or nonlinear. Table 82 shows the entries specific to this type of
shading dictionary, in addition to those common to all shading
dictionaries (see Table 78) and stream dictionaries (see Table 5).

|              |          | separate colour components. The     |
|              |          | designated function(s) shall be     |
|              |          | called with each interpolated value |
|              |          | of the parametric variable to       |
|              |          | determine the actual colour at each |

|              |          | dictionary's **Decode** array. Each |
|              |          | function's domain shall be a        |
|              |          | superset of that interval. If the   |

|              |          | a given colour component is out of  |
|              |          | range, it shall be adjusted to the  |
|              |          | nearest valid value.                |
|              |          |                                     |

|              |          | an **Indexed** colour space.        |
+--------------+----------+-------------------------------------+

Unlike shading types 1 to 3, types 4 to 7 shall be represented as
streams. Each stream contains a sequence of vertex coordinates and
colour data that defines the triangle mesh. In a type 4 shading, each
vertex is specified by the following values, in the order shown:

*f* *x* *y* *c*~1~ ... *c~n\ ~*where *f* is the vertex's edge flag
(discussed below) *x* and *y* are its horizontal and vertical
coordinates *c*~1~ ... *c~n~* are its colour components

All vertex coordinates shall be expressed in the shading's target
coordinate space. If the shading dictionary includes a **Function**
entry, only a single parametric value, *t*, shall be specified for each
vertex in place of the colour components *c*~1~ ... *c~n~* .

The *edge flag* associated with each vertex determines the way it
connects to the other vertices of the triangle mesh. A vertex *v~a~*
with an edge flag value *f~a~* = 0 begins a new triangle, unconnected to
any other. At least two more vertices *(v~b~* and *v~c~ )* shall be
provided, but their edge flags shall be ignored. These three vertices
define a triangle (*^v^~a~* , *^v^~b~* , *^v^~c~* ), as shown in Figure
24.

> **Figure 24 -- Starting a New Triangle in a Free-form Gouraud-shaded
> Triangle Mesh**

Subsequent triangles shall be defined by a single new vertex combined
with two vertices of the preceding triangle. Given triangle (*v~a~* ,
*v~b~* , *v~c~* ), where vertex *v~a~* precedes vertex *v~b~* in the
data stream and *v~b~* precedes *v~c~* , a new vertex *v~d~* can form a
new triangle on side *v~bc~* or side *v~ac~* , as shown in Figure 25.
(Side *v~ab~* is assumed to be shared with a preceding triangle and
therefore is not available for continuing the mesh.) If the edge flag is
*f~d~* = 1 (side *^v^~bc~* ), the next vertex forms the triangle
(*^v^~b~* , *^v^~c~* , *^v^~d~* ); if the edge flag is *^f^~d~* = 2
(side *^v^~ac~* ), the next vertex forms the triangle (*v~a~* , *v~c~* ,
*v~d~* ). An edge flag of *f~d~* = 0 starts a new triangle, as described
above.

Complex shapes can be created by using the edge flags to control the
edge on which subsequent triangles are

> Mesh 2 again begins with triangle 1 and uses the following edge flags:

1.  (f~a~ = f~b~ = f~c~ = 0) 4 (f~f~ = 2)

2.  (f~d~ = 1) 5 (f~g~ = 2) 3 (f~e~ = 2) 6 (f~h~ = 2)

The stream shall provide vertex data for a whole number of triangles
with appropriate edge flags; otherwise, an error occurs.

> **Figure 26 -- Varying the Value of the Edge Flag to Create Different
> Shapes**

The data for each vertex consists of the following items, reading in
sequence from higher-order to lower-order bit positions:

- An edge flag, expressed in **BitsPerFlag** bits

- A pair of horizontal and vertical coordinates, expressed in
  **BitsPerCoordinate** bits each

- A set of *n* colour components (where *n* is the number of components
  in the shading's colour space), expressed in **BitsPerComponent** bits
  each, in the order expected by the **sc** operator

Each set of vertex data shall occupy a whole number of bytes. If the
total number of bits required is not divisible by 8, the last data byte
for each vertex is padded at the end with extra bits, which shall be
ignored. The coordinates and colour values shall be decoded according to
the **Decode** array in the same way as in an image dictionary (see
8.9.5.2, \"Decode Arrays\").

If the shading dictionary contains a **Function** entry, the colour data
for each vertex shall be specified by a single parametric value *t*
rather than by *n* separate colour components. All linear interpolation
within the triangle mesh shall be done using the *t* values. After
interpolation, the results shall be passed to the function(s) specified
in the **Function** entry to determine the colour at each point.

> **8.7.4.5.6 Type 5 Shadings (Lattice-Form Gouraud-Shaded Triangle
> Meshes)**

Type 5 shadings (lattice-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes) are
similar to type 4, but instead of using freeform geometry, their
vertices are arranged in a *pseudorectangular lattice*, which is
topologically equivalent to a rectangular grid. The vertices are
organized into rows, which need not be geometrically linear (see Figure
27).

> **Figure 27 -- Lattice-form Triangle Meshes**

Table 83 shows the shading dictionary entries specific to this type of
shading, in addition to those common to all shading dictionaries (see
Table 78) and stream dictionaries (see Table 5).

The data stream for a type 5 shading has the same format as for type 4,
except that type 5 does not use edge flags to define the geometry of the
triangle mesh. The data for each vertex thus consists of the following
values, in the order shown:

*x* *y* *c*~1~ ... *c~n\ ~*where *x* and *y* shall be the vertex's
horizontal and vertical coordinates *c*~1~ ... *c~n~* shall be its
colour components

All vertex coordinates are expressed in the shading's target coordinate
space. If the shading dictionary includes a **Function** entry, only a
single parametric value, *t*, shall be present for each vertex in place
of the colour components *c*~1~ ... *c~n~* .

The **VerticesPerRow** entry in the shading dictionary gives the number
of vertices in each row of the lattice. All of the vertices in a row
shall be specified sequentially, followed by those for the next row.
Given *m* rows of *k* vertices each, the triangles of the mesh shall be
constructed using the following triplets of vertices, as shown in Figure
27:

(Vi j, , Vi j 1, + , Vi 1+ ,j ) for 0 ≤ i ≤ m -- 2, 0≤ j ≤ k -- 2

> (Vi j 1, + , Vi 1+ ,j, Vi 1+ , +j 1)

See 8.7.4.5.5, \"Type 4 Shadings (Free-Form Gouraud-Shaded Triangle
Meshes)\" for further details on the format of the vertex data.

> **8.7.4.5.7 Type 6 Shadings (Coons Patch Meshes)**

Type 6 shadings (Coons patch meshes) are constructed from one or more
*colour patches*, each bounded by four cubic Bézier curves. Degenerate
Bézier curves are allowed and are useful for certain graphical effects.
At least one complete patch shall be specified.

A Coons patch generally has two independent aspects:

- Colours are specified for each corner of the unit square, and bilinear
  interpolation is used to fill in colours over the entire unit square
  (see the upper figure in Figure L.15 in Annex L).

- Coordinates are mapped from the unit square into a four-sided patch
  whose sides are not necessarily linear (see the lower figure in Figure
  L.15 in Annex L). The mapping is continuous: the corners of the unit
  square map to corners of the patch and the sides of the unit square
  map to sides of the patch, as shown in Figure 28.

The sides of the patch are given by four cubic Bézier curves, *C*~1~ ,
*C*~2~ , *D*~1~ , and *D*~2~ , defined over a pair of parametric
variables, *u* and v, that vary horizontally and vertically across the
unit square. The four corners of the Coons patch satisfy the following
equations:

C~1~( )0 = D~1~( )0

C~1~( )1 = D~2~( )0

C~2~( )0 = D~1~( )1

C~2~( )1 = D~2~( )1

> **Figure 28 -- Coordinate Mapping from a Unit Square to a Four-sided
> Coons Patch**

Two surfaces can be described that are linear interpolations between the
boundary curves. Along the *u* axis, the surface *S~C~* is defined by

S~C~(u v, ) = (1 -- v) × C~1~( )u + v × C~2~( )u

Along the *v* axis, the surface *S~D~* is given by

S~D~(u v, ) = (1 -- u) × D~1~( )v + u × D~2~( )v

A third surface is the bilinear interpolation of the four corners:

S~B~(u v, ) = (1 -- v) × \[(1 -- u) × C~1~( )0 + u × C~1~( )1 \]

> \+ v × \[(1 -- u) × C~2~( )0 + u × C~2~( )1 \]

The coordinate mapping for the shading is given by the surface *S*,
defined as

> S = SC + SD -- SB

This defines the geometry of each patch. A patch mesh is constructed
from a sequence of one or more such coloured patches.

Patches can sometimes appear to fold over on themselves---for example,
if a boundary curve intersects itself. As the value of parameter *u* or
*v* increases in parameter space, the location of the corresponding
pixels in device space may change direction so that new pixels are
mapped onto previous pixels already mapped. If more than one point (*u*,
*v*) in parameter space is mapped to the same point in device space, the
point selected shall be the one with the largest value of *v*. If
multiple points have the same *v*, the one with the largest value of *u*
shall be selected. If one patch overlaps another, the patch that appears
later in the data stream shall paint over the earlier one.

NOTE The patch is a control surface rather than a painting geometry. The
outline of a projected square (that is, the painted area) might not be
the same as the patch boundary if, for example, the patch folds over on
itself, as shown in Figure 29.

+-----------------------+----------+-------------------------------------+

The data stream provides a sequence of Bézier control points and colour
values that define the shape and colours of each patch. All of a patch's
control points are given first, followed by the colour values for its
corners. This differs from a triangle mesh (shading types 4 and 5), in
which the coordinates and colour of each vertex are given together. All
control point coordinates are expressed in the shading's target
coordinate space. See 8.7.4.5.5, \"Type 4 Shadings (Free-Form
Gouraud-Shaded Triangle Meshes)\" for further details on the format of
the data.

As in free-form triangle meshes (type 4), each patch has an *edge flag*
that indicates which edge, if any, it shares with the previous patch. An
edge flag of 0 begins a new patch, unconnected to any other. This shall
be followed by 12 pairs of coordinates, *x*~1~ *y*~1~ *x*~2~ *y*~2~ ...
*x*~12~ *y*~12~ , which specify the Bézier control points that define
the four boundary curves. Figure 30 shows how these control points
correspond to the cubic Bézier curves *C*~1~ , *C*~2~ , *D*~1~ , and
*D*~2~ identified in Figure 28. Colour values shall be given for the
four corners of the patch, in the same order as the control points
corresponding to the corners. Thus, *c*~1~ is the colour at coordinates
(*x*~1~ , *y*~1~ ), *c*~2~ at (*x*~4~ , *y*~4~ ), *c*~3~ at (*x*~7~ ,
*y*~7~ ), and *c*~4~ at (*x*~10~ , *y*~10~ ), as shown in the figure.

> **Figure 30 -- Colour Values and Edge Flags in Coons Patch Meshes**

Figure 30 also shows how nonzero values of the edge flag (*f* = 1, 2, or
3) connect a new patch to one of the edges of the previous patch. In
this case, some of the previous patch's control points serve implicitly
as control points for the new patch as well (see Figure 31), and
therefore shall not be explicitly repeated in the data stream. Table 85
summarizes the required data values for various values of the edge flag.

If the shading dictionary contains a **Function** entry, the colour data
for each corner of a patch shall be specified by a single parametric
value *t* rather than by *n* separate colour components *c*~1~ ...
*c~n~* . All linear interpolation within the mesh shall be done using
the *t* values. After interpolation, the results shall be passed to the
function(s) specified in the **Function** entry to determine the colour
at each point.

> **8.7.4.5.8 Type 7 Shadings (Tensor-Product Patch Meshes)**

Type 7 shadings (tensor-product patch meshes) are identical to type 6,
except that they are based on a bicubic tensor-product patch defined by
16 control points instead of the 12 control points that define a Coons
patch. The shading dictionaries representing the two patch types differ
only in the value of the **ShadingType** entry and in the number of
control points specified for each patch in the data stream.

NOTE Although the Coons patch is more concise and easier to use, the
tensor-product patch affords greater control over colour mapping.

Like the Coons patch mapping, the tensor-product patch mapping is
controlled by the location and shape of four cubic Bézier curves marking
the boundaries of the patch. However, the tensor-product patch has four
additional, "internal" control points to adjust the mapping. The 16
control points can be arranged in a 4-by-4 array indexed by row and
column, as follows (see Figure 32):

> *p*03 *p*13 *p*23 *p*33 *p*02 *p*12 *p*22 *p*32 *p*01 *p*11 *p*21
> *p*31 *p*00 *p*10 *p*20 *p*30
>
> **Figure 32 -- Control Points in a Tensor-product Patch**

As in a Coons patch mesh, the geometry of the tensor-product patch is
described by a surface defined over a pair of parametric variables, *u*
and *v*, which vary horizontally and vertically across the unit square.
The surface is defined by the equation

3 3

> S u v( , ) = ∑∑ p~ij~ × B~i~( )u × B~j~( )v i = 0 j = 0

where *p~ij~* is the control point in column *i* and row *j* of the
tensor, and *B~i~* and *B~j~* are the *Bernstein polynomials*

B~0~( )t = (1 -- *t*)^3^

> B~1~( )t = 3t × (1 -- *t*)^2^ B~2~( )t = 3*t*^2^ × (1 -- t)

B~3~( )t = *~t~*3

Since each point *p~ij~* is actually a pair of coordinates (*x~ij~* ,
*y~ij~* ), the surface can also be expressed as

3 3

x.  u v( , ) = ∑∑ x~ij~ × B~i~ ( )u × B~j~ ( )v i = 0 j = 0

3 3

y.  u v( , ) = ∑∑ y~ij~ × B~i~ ( )u × B~j~ ( )v i = 0 j = 0

The geometry of the tensor-product patch can be visualized in terms of a
cubic Bézier curve moving from the bottom boundary of the patch to the
top. At the bottom and top, the control points of this curve coincide
with those of the patch's bottom (*p*~00~ ... *p*~30~ ) and top (*p*~03~
... *p*~33~ ) boundary curves, respectively. As the curve moves from the
bottom edge of the patch to the top, each of its four control points
follows a trajectory that is in turn a cubic Bézier curve defined by the
four control points in the corresponding column of the array. That is,
the starting point of the moving curve follows the trajectory defined by
control points *p*~00~ ... *p*~03~ , the trajectory of the ending point
is defined by points *p*~30~ ... *p*~33~ , and those of the two
intermediate control points by *p*~10~ ... *p*~13~ and *p*~20~ ...
*p*~23~ . Equivalently, the patch can be considered to be traced by a
cubic Bézier curve moving from the left edge to the right, with its
control points following the trajectories defined by the rows of the
coordinate array instead of the columns.

The Coons patch (type 6) is actually a special case of the
tensor-product patch (type 7) in which the four internal control points
(*p*~11~ , *p*~12~ , *p*~21~ , *p*~22~ ) are implicitly defined by the
boundary curves. The values of the internal control points are given by
these equations:

^p^11 = 1 9⁄ ×

> \[--4 × p~00~ + 6 × (p~01~ + p~10~) -- 2 × (p~03~ + p~30~) + 3 ×
> (p~31~ + p~13~) -- 1 × p~33~\]

^p^12 = 1 9⁄ ×

> \[--4 × p03 + 6 × (p02 + p13) -- 2 × (p00 + p33) + 3 × (p32 + p10) --
> 1 × p30\]

^p^21 = 1 9⁄ ×

> \[--4 × p~30~ + 6 × (p~31~ + p~20~) -- 2 × (p~33~ + p~00~) + 3 ×
> (p~01~ + p~23~) -- 1 × p~03~\]

^p^22 = 1 9⁄ ×

> \[--4 × p33 + 6 × (p32 + p23) -- 2 × (p30 + p03) + 3 × (p02 + p20) --
> 1 × p00\]

In the more general tensor-product patch, the values of these four
points are unrestricted.

The coordinates of the control points in a tensor-product patch shall be
specified in the shading's data stream in the following order:

4 5 6 7

> 3 14 15 8 2 13 16 9
>
> 1 12 11 10

All control point coordinates shall be expressed in the shading's target
coordinate space. These shall be followed by the colour values for the
four corners of the patch, in the same order as the corners themselves.
If the patch's edge flag *f* is 0, all 16 control points and four corner
colours shall be explicitly specified in the data stream. If *f* is 1,
2, or 3, the control points and colours for the patch's shared edge are
implicitly understood to be the same as those along the specified edge
of the previous patch and shall not be repeated in the data stream.
Table 86 summarizes the data values for various values of the edge flag
*f*, expressed in terms of the row and column indices used in Figure 32.
See 8.7.4.5.5, \"Type 4 Shadings (Free-Form Gouraud-Shaded Triangle
Meshes)\" for further details on the format of the data.

###  8.8 External Objects

**8.8.1 General**

An *external object* (commonly called an *XObject*) is a graphics object
whose contents are defined by a selfcontained stream, separate from the
content stream in which it is used. There are three types of external
objects:

- An *image XObject* (8.9.5, \"Image Dictionaries\") represents a
  sampled visual image such as a photograph.

- A *form XObject* (8.10, \"Form XObjects\") is a self-contained
  description of an arbitrary sequence of graphics objects.

- A *PostScript XObject* (8.8.2, \"PostScript XObjects\") contains a
  fragment of code expressed in the PostScript page description
  language. PostScript XObjects should not be used.

Two further categories of external objects, *group XObjects* and
*reference XObjects (both PDF 1.4)*, are actually specialized types of
form XObjects with additional properties. See 8.10.3, \"Group XObjects\"
and 8.10.4, \"Reference XObjects\" for additional information.

Any XObject can be painted as part of another content stream by means of
the **Do** operator (see Table 87). This operator applies to any type of
XObject---image, form, or PostScript. The syntax is the same in all
cases, although details of the operator's behaviour differ depending on
the type.

> **Table 87 -- XObject Operator**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Operands**   **Operator**   **Description**
  -------------- -------------- -----------------------------------------
  *name*         **Do**         Paint the specified XObject. The operand
                                *name* shall appear as a key in the
                                **XObject** subdictionary of the current
                                resource dictionary (see 7.8.3,
                                \"Resource Dictionaries\"). The
                                associated value shall be a stream whose
                                **Type** entry, if present, is
                                **XObject**. The effect of **Do** depends
                                on the value of the XObject's **Subtype**
                                entry, which may be **Image** (see 8.9.5,
                                \"Image Dictionaries\"), **Form** (see
                                8.10, \"Form XObjects\"), or **PS** (see
                                8.8.2, \"PostScript XObjects\").

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**8.8.2 PostScript XObjects**

Beginning with PDF 1.1, a content stream may include PostScript language
fragments. These fragments may be used only when printing to a
PostScript output device; they shall have no effect either when viewing
the document on-screen or when printing it to a non-PostScript device.
In addition, conforming readers may not be able to interpret the
PostScript fragments. Hence, this capability should be used with extreme
caution and only if there is no other way to achieve the same result.
Inappropriate use of PostScript XObjects can cause PDF files to print
incorrectly.

A *PostScript XObject* is an XObject stream whose **Subtype** entry has
the value **PS**. A PostScript XObject dictionary may contain the
entries shown in Table 88 in addition to the usual entries common to all
streams (see Table 5).

> **Table 88 -- Additional Entries Specific to a PostScript XObject
> Dictionary**

+-------------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **Key**     | **Type** | **Value**                                |
+:============+:=========+==========================================+
| **Type**    | name     | *(Optional)* The type of PDF object that |
|             |          | this dictionary describes; if present,   |
|             |          | shall be **XObject** for a PostScript    |
|             |          | XObject.                                 |
+-------------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **Subtype** | name     | *(Required)* The type of XObject that    |
|             |          | this dictionary describes; shall be      |
|             |          | **PS** for a PostScript XObject.         |
|             |          |                                          |
|             |          | Alternatively, the value of this entry   |
|             |          | may be **Form**, with an additional      |
|             |          | **Subtype2** entry whose value shall be  |
|             |          | **PS**.                                  |
+-------------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **Level1**  | stream   | *(Optional)* A stream whose contents     |
|             |          | shall be used in place of the PostScript |
|             |          | XObject's stream when the target         |
|             |          | PostScript interpreter is known to       |
|             |          | support only LanguageLevel 1.            |
+-------------+----------+------------------------------------------+

If a PDF content stream is translated by a conforming reader into the
PostScript language, any **Do** operation that references a PostScript
XObject may be replaced by the contents of the XObject stream itself.
The stream shall be copied without interpretation. The PostScript
fragment may use Type 1 and TrueType fonts listed in the **Font**
subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, \"Resource
Dictionaries\"), accessing them by their **BaseFont** names using the
PostScript **findfont** operator. The fragment shall not use other types
of fonts listed in the **Font** subdictionary. It should not reference
the PostScript definitions corresponding to PDF procedure sets (see
14.2, \"Procedure Sets\"), which are subject to change.

###  8.9 Images

**8.9.1 General**

PDF's painting operators include general facilities for dealing with
sampled images. A *sampled image* (or just *image* for short) is a
rectangular array of *sample values*, each representing a colour. The
image may approximate the appearance of some natural scene obtained
through an input scanner or a video camera, or it may be generated
synthetically.

| 2    |                                                            |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+

> An *image XObject* (described in 8.9.5, \"Image Dictionaries\") is a
> stream object whose dictionary specifies attributes of the image and
> whose data contains the image samples. Like all external objects, it
> is painted on the page by invoking the **Do** operator in a content

> Images\"), image masks (8.9.6, \"Masked Images\"), and thumbnail
> images (12.3.4, \"Thumbnail Images\").
>
> An *inline image* is a small image that is completely defined---both
> attributes and data---directly inline within a content stream. The
> kinds of images that can be represented in this way are limited; see
> 8.9.7, \"Inline Images\" for details.

**8.9.2 Image Parameters**

The properties of an image---resolution, orientation, scanning order,
and so forth---are entirely independent of the characteristics of the
raster output device on which the image is to be rendered. A conforming
reader usually renders images by a sampling technique that attempts to
approximate the colour values of the source as accurately as possible.
The actual accuracy achieved depends on the resolution and other
properties of the output device.

To paint an image, four interrelated items shall be specified:

- The format of the image: number of columns (width), number of rows
  (height), number of colour components per sample, and number of bits
  per colour component

- The sample data constituting the image's visual content

- The correspondence between coordinates in user space and those in the
  image's own internal coordinate space, defining the region of user
  space that will receive the image

- The mapping from colour component values in the image data to
  component values in the image's colour space

All of these items shall be specified explicitly or implicitly by an
image XObject or an inline image.

NOTE For convenience, the following sub-clauses refer consistently to
the object defining an image as an *image dictionary*. Although this
term properly refers only to the dictionary portion of the stream object
representing an image XObject, it should be understood to apply equally
to the stream's data portion or to the parameters and data of an inline
image.

**8.9.3 Sample Representation**

The source format for an image shall be described by four parameters:

- The width of the image in samples

- The height of the image in samples

- The number of colour components per sample

- The number of bits per colour component

The image dictionary shall specify the width, height, and number of bits
per component explicitly. The number of colour components shall be
inferred from the colour space specified in the dictionary.

NOTE For images using the *JPXDecode* filter (see 7.4.9, \"JPXDecode
Filter\"), the number of bits per component is determined from the image
data and not specified in the image dictionary. The colour space may or
may not be specified in the dictionary.

Sample data shall be represented as a stream of bytes, interpreted as
8-bit unsigned integers in the range 0 to 255. The bytes constitute a
continuous bit stream, with the high-order bit of each byte first. This
bit stream, in turn, is divided into units of *n* bits each, where *n*
is the number of bits per component. Each unit encodes a colour
component value, given with high-order bit first; units of 16 bits shall
be given with the most significant byte first. Byte boundaries shall be
ignored, except that each row of sample data shall begin on a byte
boundary. If the number of data bits per row is not a multiple of 8, the
end of the row is padded with extra bits to fill out the last byte. A
conforming reader shall ignore these padding bits.

Each *n*-bit unit within the bit stream shall be interpreted as an
unsigned integer in the range 0 to 2*^n^*- 1, with the high-order bit
first. The image dictionary's **Decode** entry maps this integer to a
colour component value, equivalent to what could be used with colour
operators such as **sc** or **g**. Colour components shall be
interleaved sample by sample; for example, in a three-component *RGB*
image, the red, green, and blue components for one sample are followed
by the red, green, and blue components for the next.

If the image dictionary\'s **ImageMask** entry is **false** or absent,
the colour samples in an image shall be interpreted according to the
colour space specified in the image dictionary (see 8.6, \"Colour
Spaces\"), without reference to the colour parameters in the graphics
state. However, if the image dictionary's **ImageMask** entry is
**true**, the sample data shall be interpreted as a *stencil mask* for
applying the graphics state's nonstroking colour parameters (see
8.9.6.2, \"Stencil Masking\").

**8.9.4 Image Coordinate System**

Each image has its own internal coordinate system, or *image space*. The
image occupies a rectangle in image space *w* units wide and *h* units
high, where *w* and *h* are the width and height of the image in
samples. Each sample occupies one square unit. The coordinate origin (0,
0) is at the upper-left corner of the image, with coordinates ranging
from 0 to *w* horizontally and 0 to *h* vertically.

The image's sample data is ordered by row, with the horizontal
coordinate varying most rapidly. This is shown in Figure 34, where the
numbers inside the squares indicate the order of the samples, counting
from 0. The upper-left corner of the first sample is at coordinates (0,
0), the second at (1, 0), and so on through the last sample of the first
row, whose upper-left corner is at (*w* - 1, 0) and whose upper-right
corner is at (*w*, 0). The next samples after that are at coordinates
(0, 1), (1, 1), and so on to the final sample of the image, whose
upper-left corner is at (*w* - 1, *h* - 1) and whose lower-right corner
is at (*w*, *h*).

NOTE The image coordinate system and scanning order imposed by PDF do
not preclude using different conventions in the actual image. Coordinate
transformations can be used to map from other conventions to the PDF
convention.

The correspondence between image space and user space is constant: the
unit square of user space, bounded by user coordinates (0, 0) and (1,
1), corresponds to the boundary of the image in image space (see Figure
35). Following the normal convention for user space, the coordinate (0,
0) is at the *lower-left* corner of this square, corresponding to
coordinates (0, *h*) in image space. The implicit transformation from
image space to user space, if specified explicitly, would be described
by the matrix \[ 1 ⁄ *w* 0 0 -1 ⁄ *h* 0 1 \].

> **Figure 34 -- Source Image Coordinate System**
>
> **Figure 35 -- Mapping the Source Image**

An image can be placed on the output page in any position, orientation,
and size by using the **cm** operator to modify the current
transformation matrix (CTM) so as to map the unit square of user space
to the rectangle or parallelogram in which the image shall be painted.
Typically, this is done within a pair of **q** and **Q** operators to
isolate the effect of the transformation, which can include translation,
rotation, reflection, and skew (see 8.3, \"Coordinate Systems\").

EXAMPLE If the **XObject** subdictionary of the current resource
dictionary defines the name Image1 to denote an image XObject, the code
shown in this example paints the image in a rectangle whose lower-left
corner is at coordinates (100, 200), that is rotated 45 degrees counter
clockwise, and that is 150 units wide and 80 units high.

**8.9.5 Image Dictionaries**

**8.9.5.1 General**

An image dictionary---that is, the dictionary portion of a stream
representing an image XObject---may contain the entries listed in Table
89 in addition to the usual entries common to all streams (see Table 5).
There are many relationships among these entries, and the current colour
space may limit the choices for some of them. Attempting to use an image
dictionary whose entries are inconsistent with each other or with the
current colour space shall cause an error.

The entries described here are appropriate for a *base image*---one that
is invoked directly with the ***Do*** operator. Some of the entries
should not be used for images used in other ways, such as for alternate
images (see 8.9.5.4, \"Alternate Images\"), image masks (see 8.9.6,
\"Masked Images\"), or thumbnail images (see 12.3.4,

\"Thumbnail Images\"). Except as noted, such irrelevant entries are
simply ignored by a conforming reader

| **8.9.5.2** | **Decode Arrays**              |                     |
+-------------+--------------------------------+---------------------+

An image's data stream is initially decomposed into integers in the
domain 0 to 2*^n^* -1, where *n* is the value of the image dictionary's
**BitsPerComponent** entry. The image's **Decode** array specifies a
linear mapping of each integer component value to a number that would be
appropriate as a component value in the image's colour space.

Each pair of numbers in a **Decode** array specifies the lower and upper
values to which the domain of sample values in the image is mapped. A
**Decode** array shall contain one pair of numbers for each component in
the colour space specified by the image's **ColorSpace** entry. The
mapping for each colour component, by a conforming reader shall be a
linear transformation; that is, it shall use the following formula for
linear interpolation:

y = Interpolate x x( , ~min~, x~max~, y~min~, y~max~)

⎛ \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--ymax -- ymin ⎞⎟

> = y~min~ + ⎜(x -- x~min~) × x~max\ --~ x~min\ ⎠~
>
> ~⎝~

This formula is used to convert a value *x* between *x*~min~ and
*x*~max~ to a corresponding value *y* between *y*~min~ and *y*~max~ ,
projecting along the line defined by the points (*x*~min~ , *y*~min~ )
and (*x*~max~ , *y*~max~ ).

NOTE 1 While this formula applies to values outside the domain *x*~min~
to *x*~max~ and does not require that *x*~min~ \< *x*~max~ , note that
interpolation used for colour conversion, such as the **Decode** array,
does require that *x*~min~ \< *x*~max~ and clips *x* values to this
domain so that *y* = *y*~min~ for all *x* £ *x*~min~ , and *y* =
*y*~max~ for all *x* Š *x*~max~ .

For a **Decode** array of the form \[ *D*~min~ *D*~max~ \], this can be
written as

y = Interpolate x 0 2( , , ^n^-- 1, *^D^*~min~, *^D^*~max~)

> = *^D^*~min~ + ⎛⎜x ×
> \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--*D*max --
> *D*min- ⎞⎟

⎝ 2n-- 1 ⎠

where *n* shall be the value of **BitsPerComponent** *x* shall be the
input value, in the domain 0 to 2*^n^* - 1

> *D*~min~ and *D*~max~ shall be the values specified in the **Decode**
> array *y* is the output value, which shall be interpreted in the
> image's colour space

Samples with a value of 0 shall be mapped to *D*~min~ , those with a
value of 2*^n^* - 1 shall be mapped to *D*~max~ , and those with
intermediate values shall be mapped linearly between *D*~min~ and
*D*~max~. Table 90 lists the default **Decode** arrays which shall be
used with the various colour spaces by a conforming reader.

NOTE 2 For most colour spaces, the **Decode** arrays listed in the table
map into the full range of allowed component values. For an **Indexed**
colour space, the default **Decode** array ensures that component values
that index a colour table are passed through unchanged.

+----------------+----------------------------------+

NOTE 3 It is possible to specify a mapping that *inverts* sample colour
intensities by specifying a *D*~min~ value greater than *D*~max~ . For
example, if the image's colour space is **DeviceGray** and the
**Decode** array is \[ 1.0 0.0 \], an input value of 0 is mapped to 1.0
(white); an input value of 2*^n^* - 1 is mapped to 0.0 (black).

The *D*~min~ and *D*~max~ parameters for a colour component need not
fall within the range of values allowed for that component.

NOTE 4 For instance, if an application uses 6-bit numbers as its native
image sample format, it can represent those samples in PDF in 8-bit
form, setting the two unused high-order bits of each sample to 0. The
image dictionary should then specify a **Decode** array of \[ 0.00000
4.04762 \], which maps input values from 0 to 63 into the range 0.0 to
1.0 (4.04762 being approximately equal to 255 ³ 63).

If an output value falls outside the range allowed for a component, it
shall be automatically adjusted to the nearest allowed value.

**8.9.5.3 Image Interpolation**

When the resolution of a source image is significantly lower than that
of the output device, each source sample covers many device pixels. As a
result, images can appear jaggy or blocky. These visual artifacts can be
reduced by applying an *image interpolation* algorithm during rendering.
Instead of painting all pixels covered by a source sample with the same
colour, image interpolation attempts to produce a smooth transition
between adjacent sample values.

Image interpolation is enabled by setting the **Interpolate** entry in
the image dictionary to **true**. It shall be disabled by default
because it may increase the time required to render the image.

NOTE A conforming Reader may choose to not implement this feature of
PDF, or may use any specific implementation of interpolation that it
wishes.

**8.9.5.4 Alternate Images**

*Alternate images* *(PDF 1.3)* provide a straightforward and
backward-compatible way to include multiple versions of an image in a
PDF file for different purposes. These variant representations of the
image may differ, for example, in resolution or in colour space. The
primary goal is to reduce the need to maintain separate versions of a
PDF document for low-resolution on-screen viewing and high-resolution
printing.

A *base image* (that is, the image XObject referred to in a resource
dictionary) may contain an **Alternates** entry. The value of this entry
shall be an array of *alternate image dictionaries* specifying variant
representations of the base image. Each alternate image dictionary shall
contain an image XObject for one variant and shall specify its
properties. Table 91 shows the contents of an alternate image
dictionary.

> **Table 91 -- Entries in an Alternate Image Dictionary**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**                  **Type**     **Value**
  ------------------------ ------------ ---------------------------------------
  **Image**                stream       *(Required)* The image XObject for the
                                        alternate image.

  **DefaultForPrinting**   boolean      *(Optional)* A flag indicating whether
                                        this alternate image shall be the
                                        default version to be used for
                                        printing. At most one alternate for a
                                        given base image shall be so
                                        designated. If no alternate has this
                                        entry set to **true**, the base image
                                        shall be used for printing by a
                                        conforming reader.

  **OC**                   dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.5)* An optional
                                        content group (see 8.11.2, \"Optional
                                        Content Groups\") or optional content
                                        membership dictionary (see 8.11.2.2,
                                        \"Optional Content Membership
                                        Dictionaries\") that facilitates the
                                        selection of which alternate image to
                                        use.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE The following shows an image with a single alternate. The base
image is a grayscale image, and the alternate is a high-resolution RGB
image stored on a Web server.

In PDF 1.5, optional content (see 8.11, \"Optional Content\") may be
used to facilitate selection between alternate images. If an image
XObject contains both an **Alternates** entry and an **OC** entry, the
choice of which image to use shall be determined as follows:

a)  If the image's **OC** entry specifies that the base image is
    visible, that image shall be displayed.

b)  Otherwise, the list of alternates specified by the **Alternates**
    entry is examined, and the first alternate containing an **OC**
    entry specifying that its content should be visible shall be shown.
    (Alternate images that have no **OC** entry shall not be shown.)

**8.9.6 Masked Images**

**8.9.6.1 General**

Ordinarily, in the opaque imaging model, images mark all areas they
occupy on the page as if with opaque paint. All portions of the image,
whether black, white, gray, or colour, completely obscure any marks that
may previously have existed in the same place on the page. In the
graphic arts industry and page layout applications, however, it is
common to crop or mask out the background of an image and then place the
masked image on a different background so that the existing background
shows through the masked areas. A number of PDF features are available
for achieving such masking effects:

- The **ImageMask** entry in the image dictionary, specifies that the
  image data shall be used as a *stencil mask* for painting in the
  current colour.

- The **Mask** entry in the image dictionary *(PDF 1.3)* specifies a
  separate image XObject which shall be used as an *explicit mask*
  specifying which areas of the image to paint and which to mask out.

- Alternatively, the **Mask** entry *(PDF 1.3)* specifies a range of
  colours which shall be masked out wherever they occur within the
  image. This technique is known as *colour key masking*.

NOTE 5 Earlier versions of PDF commonly simulated masking by defining a
clipping path enclosing only those of an image's samples that are to be
painted. However, if the clipping path is very complex (or if there is
more than one clipping path) not all conforming Readers will render the
results in the same way. An alternative way to achieve the effect of an
explicit mask is to define the image being clipped as a pattern, make it
the current colour, and then paint the explicit mask as an image whose
**ImageMask** entry is **true**.

In the transparent imaging model, a fourth type of masking effect, *soft
masking*, is available through the **SMask** entry *(PDF 1.4)* or the
**SMaskInData** entry *(PDF 1.5)* in the image dictionary; see 11.6.5,
\"Specifying Soft Masks\", for further discussion.

**8.9.6.2 Stencil Masking**

An *image mask* (an image XObject whose **ImageMask** entry is **true**)
is a monochrome image in which each sample is specified by a single bit.
However, instead of being painted in opaque black and white, the image
mask is treated as a *stencil mask* that is partly opaque and partly
transparent. Sample values in the image do not represent black and white
pixels; rather, they designate places on the page that should either be
marked with the current colour or masked out (not marked at all). Areas
that are masked out retain their former contents. The effect is like
applying paint in the current colour through a cut-out stencil, which
lets the paint reach the page in some places and masks it out in others.

An image mask differs from an ordinary image in the following
significant ways:

- The image dictionary shall not contain a **ColorSpace** entry because
  sample values represent masking properties (1 bit per sample) rather
  than colours.

- The value of the **BitsPerComponent** entry shall be 1.

- The **Decode** entry determines how the source samples shall be
  interpreted. If the **Decode** array is \[ 0 1 \] (the default for an
  image mask), a sample value of 0 shall mark the page with the current
  colour, and a 1 shall leave the previous contents unchanged. If the
  **Decode** array is \[ 1 0 \], these meanings shall be reversed.

NOTE 6 One of the most important uses of stencil masking is for painting
character glyphs represented as bitmaps. Using such a glyph as a stencil
mask transfers only its "black" bits to the page, leaving the "white"
bits (which are really just background) unchanged. For reasons discussed
in 9.6.5, \"Type 3 Fonts\", an image mask, rather than an image, should
almost always be used to paint glyph bitmaps.

If image interpolation (see 8.9.5.3, \"Image Interpolation\") is
requested during stencil masking, the effect shall be to smooth the
edges of the mask, not to interpolate the painted colour values. This
effect can minimize the jaggy appearance of a low-resolution stencil
mask.

**8.9.6.3 Explicit Masking**

In PDF 1.3, the **Mask** entry in an image dictionary may be an image
mask, as described in sub-clause 8.9.6.2, \"Stencil Masking\", which
serves as an *explicit mask* for the primary (base) image. The base
image and the image mask need not have the same resolution (**Width**
and **Height** values), but since all images shall be defined on the
unit square in user space, their boundaries on the page will coincide;
that is, they will overlay each other. The image mask indicates which
places on the page shall be painted and which shall be masked out (left
unchanged). Unmasked areas shall be painted with the corresponding
portions of the base image; masked areas shall not be.

**8.9.6.4 Colour Key Masking**

In PDF 1.3, the **Mask** entry in an image dictionary may be an array
specifying a range of colours to be masked out. Samples in the image
that fall within this range shall not be painted, allowing the existing
background to show through.

NOTE 1 The effect is similar to that of the video technique known as
chroma-key.

For colour key masking, the value of the **Mask** entry shall be an
array of 2 ¥ *n* integers, \[ *min*~1~ *max*~1~ ... *min~n~* *max~n~*
\], where *n* is the number of colour components in the image's colour
space. Each integer shall be in the range 0 to 2^BitsPerComponent^ - 1,
representing colour values *before* decoding with the **Decode** array.
An image sample shall be masked (not painted) if all of its colour
components before decoding, *c*~1~ ... *c~n~* , fall within the
specified ranges (that is, if *min~i~* £ *c~i~* £ *max~i~* for all 1 £
*i* £ *n*).

When colour key masking is specified, the use of a ***DCTDecode*** or
lossy ***JPXDecode*** filter for the stream can produce unexpected
results.

NOTE 2 ***DCTDecode*** is always a lossy filter while ***JPXDecode***
has a lossy filter option. The use of a lossy filter mean that the
output is only an approximation of the original input data. Therefore,
the use of this filter may lead to slight changes in the colour values
of image samples, possibly causing samples that were intended to be
masked to be unexpectedly painted instead, in colours slightly different
from the mask colour.

**8.9.7 Inline Images**

As an alternative to the image XObjects described in 8.9.5, \"Image
Dictionaries\", a sampled image may be specified in the form of an
*inline image*. This type of image shall be defined directly within the
content stream in which it will be painted rather than as a separate
object. Because the inline format gives the reader less flexibility in
managing the image data, it shall be used only for small images (4 KB or
less).

An inline image object shall be delimited in the content stream by the
operators **BI** (begin image), **ID** (image data), and **EI** (end
image). These operators are summarized in Table 92. **BI** and **ID**
shall bracket a series of key-value pairs specifying the characteristics
of the image, such as its dimensions and colour space; the image data
shall follow between the **ID** and **EI** operators. The format is thus
analogous to that of a stream object such as an image XObject:

> **BI**
>
> *... Key-value pairs ...* **ID**
>
> *... Image data ...*
>
> **EI**
>
> **Table 92 -- Inline Image Operators**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Operands**   **Operator**   **Description**
  -------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------
  ---            **BI**         Begin an inline image object.

  ---            **ID**         Begin the image data for an inline image
                                object.

  ---            **EI**         End an inline image object.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inline image objects shall not be nested; that is, two **BI** operators
shall not appear without an intervening **EI** to close the first
object. Similarly, an **ID** operator shall only appear between a **BI**
and its balancing **EI**. Unless the image uses **ASCIIHexDecode** or
**ASCII85Decode** as one of its filters, the **ID** operator shall be
followed by a single white-space character, and the next character shall
be interpreted as the first byte of image data.

The key-value pairs appearing between the **BI** and **ID** operators
are analogous to those in the dictionary portion of an image XObject
(though the syntax is different). Table 93 shows the entries that are
valid for an inline image, all of which shall have the same meanings as
in a stream dictionary (see Table 5) or an image dictionary (see Table
89). Entries other than those listed shall be ignored; in particular,
the **Type**, **Subtype**, and **Length** entries normally found in a
stream or image dictionary are unnecessary. For convenience, the
abbreviations shown in the table may be used in place of the fully
spelled-out keys. Table 94 shows additional abbreviations that can be
used for the names of colour spaces and filters.

These abbreviations are valid only in inline images; they shall not be
used in image XObjects. **JBIG2Decode** and **JPXDecode** are not listed
in Table 94 because those filters shall not be used with inline images.

  **DCTDecode**         **DCT**
  ----------------------------------------------

The colour space specified by the **ColorSpace** (or **CS**) entry shall
be one of the standard device colour spaces (**DeviceGray**,
**DeviceRGB**, or **DeviceCMYK**). It shall not be a CIE-based colour
space or a special colour space, with the exception of a limited form of
**Indexed** colour space whose base colour space is a device space and
whose colour table is specified by a byte string (see 8.6.6.3, \"Indexed
Colour Spaces\"). Beginning with PDF 1.2, the value of the
**ColorSpace** entry may also be the name of a colour space in the
**ColorSpace** subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see
7.8.3, \"Resource Dictionaries\"). In this case, the name may designate
any colour space that can be used with an image XObject.

NOTE 1 The names ***DeviceGray***, ***DeviceRGB***, and ***DeviceCMYK***
(as well as their abbreviations ***G***, ***RGB***, and ***CMYK***)
always identify the corresponding colour spaces directly; they never
refer to resources in the **ColorSpace** subdictionary.

The image data in an inline image may be encoded by using any of the
standard PDF filters except JPXDecode and JBIG2Decode. The bytes between
the **ID** and **EI** operators shall be treated the same as a stream
object's data (see 7.3.8, \"Stream Objects\"), even though they do not
follow the standard stream syntax.

NOTE 2 This is an exception to the usual rule that the data in a content
stream shall be interpreted according to the standard PDF syntax for
objects.

EXAMPLE This example shows an inline image 17 samples wide by 17 high
with 8 bits per component in the **DeviceRGB** colour space. The image
has been encoded using LZW and ASCII base-85 encoding. The **cm**
operator is used to scale it to a width and height of 17 units in user
space and position it at coordinates (298, 388). The **q** and **Q**
operators encapsulate the **cm** operation to limit its effect to
resizing the image.

### 8.10 Form XObjects

**8.10.1 General**

A *form XObject* is a PDF content stream that is a self-contained
description of any sequence of graphics objects (including path objects,
text objects, and sampled images). A form XObject may be painted
multiple times---either on several pages or at several locations on the
same page---and produces the same results each time, subject only to the
graphics state at the time it is invoked. Not only is this shared
definition economical to represent in the PDF file, but under suitable
circumstances the conforming reader can optimize execution by caching
the results of rendering the form XObject for repeated reuse.

NOTE 1 The term *form* also refers to a completely different kind of
object, an *interactive form* (sometimes called an *AcroForm*),
discussed in 12.7, \"Interactive Forms\". Whereas the form XObjects
described in this sub-clause correspond to the notion of forms in the
PostScript language, interactive forms are the PDF equivalent of the
familiar paper instrument. Any unqualified use of the word *form* is
understood to refer to an interactive form; the type of form described
here is always referred to explicitly as a *form XObject*.

Form XObjects have various uses:

- As its name suggests, a form XObject may serve as the template for an
  entire page.

EXAMPLE A program that prints filled-in tax forms can first paint the
fixed template as a form XObject and then paint the variable information
on top of it.

- Any graphical element that is to be used repeatedly, such as a company
  logo or a standard component in the output from a computer-aided
  design system, may be defined as a form XObject.

- Certain document elements that are not part of a page's contents, such
  as annotation appearances (see

> 12.5.5, \"Appearance Streams\"), shall be represented as form
> XObjects.

- A specialized type of form XObject, called a *group XObject (PDF
  1.4)*, can be used to group graphical elements together as a unit for
  various purposes (see 8.10.3, \"Group XObjects\"). In particular,
  group XObjects shall be used to define transparency groups and soft
  masks for use in the transparent imaging model (see 11.6.5.2,
  \"Soft-Mask Dictionaries\" and 11.6.6, \"Transparency Group
  XObjects\").

- Another specialized type of form XObject, a *reference XObject (PDF
  1.4)*, may be used to import content from one PDF document into
  another (see 8.10.4, \"Reference XObjects\").

A writer shall perform the following two specific operations in order to
use a form XObject:

a)  *Define the appearance of the form XObject*. A form XObject is a PDF
    content stream. The dictionary portion of the stream (called the
    *form dictionary*) shall contain descriptive information about the
    form XObject; the body of the stream shall describe the graphics
    objects that produce its appearance. The contents of the form
    dictionary are described in 8.10.2, \"Form Dictionaries\".

b)  *Paint the form XObject*. The **Do** operator (see 8.8, \"External
    Objects\") shall paint a form XObject whose name is supplied as an
    operand. The name shall be defined in the **XObject** subdictionary
    of the current resource dictionary. Before invoking this operator,
    the content stream in which it appears should set appropriate
    parameters in the graphics state. In particular, it should alter the
    current transformation matrix to control the position, size, and
    orientation of the form XObject in user space.

Each form XObject is defined in its own coordinate system, called *form
space*. The **BBox** entry in the form dictionary shall be expressed in
form space, as shall be any coordinates used in the form XObject's
content stream, such as path coordinates. The **Matrix** entry in the
form dictionary shall specify the mapping from form space to the current
user space. Each time the form XObject is painted by the **Do**
operator, this matrix shall be concatenated with the current
transformation matrix to define the mapping from form space to device
space.

NOTE 2 This differs from the **Matrix** entry in a pattern dictionary,
which maps pattern space to the initial user space of the content stream
in which the pattern is used.

When the **Do** operator is applied to a form XObject, a conforming
reader shall perform the following tasks:

a)  Saves the current graphics state, as if by invoking the **q**
    operator (see 8.4.4, \"Graphics State Operators\")

b)  Concatenates the matrix from the form dictionary's **Matrix** entry
    with the current transformation matrix (CTM) c) Clips according to
    the form dictionary's **BBox** entry

<!-- -->

d)  Paints the graphics objects specified in the form's content stream

e)  Restores the saved graphics state, as if by invoking the **Q**
    operator (see 8.4.4, \"Graphics State Operators\")

Except as described above, the initial graphics state for the form shall
be inherited from the graphics state that is in effect at the time
**Do** is invoked.

**8.10.2 Form Dictionaries**

Every form XObject shall have a *form type*, which determines the format
and meaning of the entries in its form dictionary. This specification
only defines one form type, Type 1. Form XObject dictionaries may
contain the entries shown in Table 95, in addition to the usual entries
common to all streams (see Table 5).

**8.10.3 Group XObjects**

A *group XObject* *(PDF 1.4)* is a special type of form XObject that can
be used to group graphical elements together as a unit for various
purposes. It shall be distinguished by the presence of the optional
**Group** entry in the form dictionary (see 8.10.2, \"Form
Dictionaries\"). The value of this entry shall be a subsidiary *group
attributes dictionary* describing the properties of the group.

As shown in Table 96, every group XObject shall have a *group subtype*
(specified by the **S** entry in the group attributes dictionary) that
determines the format and meaning of the dictionary's remaining entries.
This specification only defines one subtype, a *transparency group
XObject* (subtype **Transparency**) representing a transparency group
for use in the transparent imaging model (see 11.4, \"Transparency
Groups\"). The remaining contents of this type of dictionary are
described in 11.6.6, \"Transparency Group XObjects\". **Table 96 --
Entries Common to all Group Attributes Dictionaries**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**   **Value**
  ---------- ---------- -----------------------------------------
  **Type**   name       *(Optional)* The type of PDF object that
                        this dictionary describes; if present,
                        shall be **Group** for a group attributes
                        dictionary.

  **S**      name       *(Required)* The *group subtype*, which
                        identifies the type of group whose
                        attributes this dictionary describes and
                        determines the format and meaning of the
                        dictionary's remaining entries. The only
                        group subtype defined is
                        **Transparency**; see 11.6.6,
                        \"Transparency Group XObjects\", for the
                        remaining contents of this type of
                        dictionary.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

**8.10.4 Reference XObjects**

> **8.10.4.1 General**

*Reference XObjects (PDF 1.4)* enable one PDF document to import content
from another. The document in which the reference occurs is called the
*containing document*; the one whose content is being imported is the
*target document*. The target document may reside in a file external to
the containing document or may be included within it as an embedded file
stream (see 7.11.4, \"Embedded File Streams\").

The reference XObject in the containing document shall be a form XObject
containing the **Ref** entry in its form dictionary, as described below.
This form XObject shall serve as a *proxy* that shall be displayed or
printed by a conforming reader in place of the imported content.

NOTE 3 The proxy might consist of a low-resolution image of the imported
content, a piece of descriptive text referring to it, a gray box to be
displayed in its place, or any other similar placeholder.

Conforming readers that do not recognize the **Ref** entry shall simply
display or print the proxy as an ordinary form XObject. Those readers
that do implement reference XObjects shall use the proxy in place of the
imported content if the latter is unavailable. A conforming reader may
also provide a user interface to allow editing and updating of imported
content links.

The imported content shall consist of a single, complete PDF page in the
target document. It shall be designated by a *reference dictionary*,
which in turn shall be the value of the **Ref** entry in the reference
XObject's form dictionary (see 8.10.2, \"Form Dictionaries\"). The
presence of the **Ref** entry shall distinguish reference XObjects from
other types of form XObjects. Table 97 shows the contents of the
reference dictionary.

> **Table 97 -- Entries in a Reference Dictionary**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**        **Value**
  ---------- --------------- ---------------------------------------
  **F**      file            *(Required)* The file containing the
             specification   target document.

  **Page**   integer or text *(Required)* A page index or page label
             string          (see 12.4.2, \"Page Labels\")
                             identifying the page of the target
                             document containing the content to be
                             imported. This reference is a weak one
                             and may be inadvertently invalidated if
                             the referenced page is changed or
                             replaced in the target document after
                             the reference is created.

  **ID**     array           *(Optional)* An array of two byte
                             strings constituting a file identifier
                             (see 14.4, \"File Identifiers\") for
                             the file containing the target
                             document. The use of this entry
                             improves an reader's chances of finding
                             the intended file and allows it to warn
                             the user if the file has changed since
                             the reference was created.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

When the imported content replaces the proxy, it shall be transformed
according to the proxy object's transformation matrix and clipped to the
boundaries of its bounding box, as specified by the **Matrix** and
**BBox** entries in the proxy's form dictionary (see 8.10.2, \"Form
Dictionaries\"). The combination of the proxy object's matrix and
bounding box thus implicitly defines the bounding box of the imported
page. This bounding box typically coincides with the imported page's
crop box or art box (see 14.11.2, \"Page Boundaries\"), but may not
correspond to any of the defined page boundaries. If the proxy object's
form dictionary contains a **Group** entry, the specified group
attributes shall apply to the imported page as well, which allows the
imported page to be treated as a group without further modification.

> **8.10.4.2 Printing Reference XObjects**

When printing a page containing reference XObjects, an application may
emit any of the following items, depending on the capabilities of the
conforming reader, the user's preferences, and the nature of the print
job:

- The imported content designated by the reference XObject

- The reference XObject as a proxy for the imported content

- An OPI proxy or substitute image taken from the reference XObject's
  OPI dictionary, if any (see 14.11.7, \"Open Prepress Interface
  (OPI)\")

The imported content or the reference XObject may also be emitted, by a
conforming reader, in place of an OPI proxy when generating OPI comments
in a PostScript output stream.

> **8.10.4.3 Special Considerations**

Certain special considerations arise when reference XObjects interact
with other PDF features:

- When the page imported by a reference XObject contains annotations
  (see 12.5, \"Annotations\"), all annotations that contain a printable,
  unhidden, visible appearance stream (12.5.5, \"Appearance Streams\")
  shall be included in the rendering of the imported page. If the proxy
  is a snapshot image of the imported page, it shall also include the
  annotation appearances. These appearances shall therefore be converted
  into part of the proxy's content stream, either as subsidiary form
  XObjects or by flattening them directly into the content stream.

- Logical structure information associated with a page (see 14.7,
  \"Logical Structure\") may be ignored when importing the page into
  another document with a reference XObject. In a target document with
  multiple pages, structure elements occurring on the imported page are
  typically part of a larger structure pertaining to the document as a
  whole; such elements cannot meaningfully be incorporated into the
  structure of the containing document. In a one-page target document or
  one made up of independent, structurally unrelated pages, the logical
  structure for the imported page may be wholly self-contained; in this
  case, it may be possible to incorporate this structure information
  into that of the containing document. However, PDF provides no
  mechanism for the logical structure hierarchy of one document to refer
  indirectly to that of another.

### 8.11 Optional Content

**8.11.1 General**

*Optional content* *(PDF 1.5)* refers to sub-clauses of content in a PDF
document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or
consumers. This capability is useful in items such as CAD drawings,
layered artwork, maps, and multi-language documents.

NOTE The following sub-clauses describe the PDF structures used to
implement optional content:

> 8.11.2, \"Optional Content Groups\", describes the primary structures
> used to control the visibility of content.
>
> 8.11.3, \"Making Graphical Content Optional\", describes how
> individual pieces of content in a document may declare themselves as
> belonging to one or more optional content groups.
>
> 8.11.4, \"Configuring Optional Content\", describes how the states of
> optional content groups are set.

**8.11.2 Optional Content Groups**

> **8.11.2.1 General**

An optional content group is a dictionary representing a collection of
graphics that can be made visible or invisible dynamically by users of
conforming readers. The graphics belonging to such a group may reside
anywhere in the document: they need not be consecutive in drawing order,
nor even belong to the same content stream. Table 98 shows the entries
in an optional content group dictionary.

> **Table 98 -- Entries in an Optional Content Group Dictionary**

+------------+------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Key**    | **Type**   | **Value**                              |

| **Type**   | name       | *(Required)* The type of PDF object    |
|            |            | that this dictionary describes; shall  |
|            |            | be **OCG** for an optional content     |
|            |            | group dictionary.                      |
+------------+------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Name**   | text       | *(Required)* The name of the optional  |
|            | string     | content group, suitable for            |
|            |            | presentation in a reader's user        |
|            |            | interface.                             |
+------------+------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Intent** | name or    | *(Optional)* A single intent name or   |
|            |            | an array containing any combination of |
|            | array      | names. PDF defines two names, *View*   |
|            |            | and *Design*, that may indicate the    |
|            |            | intended use of the graphics in the    |
|            |            | group. A conforming reader may choose  |
|            |            | to use only groups that have a         |
|            |            | specific intent and ignore others.     |
|            |            |                                        |
|            |            | Default value: *View*. See 8.11.2.3,   |
|            |            | \"Intent\" for more information.       |
+------------+------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Usage**  | dictionary | *(Optional)* A *usage dictionary*      |
|            |            | describing the nature of the content   |
|            |            | controlled by the group. It may be     |
|            |            | used by features that automatically    |
|            |            | control the state of the group based   |
|            |            | on outside factors. See 8.11.4.4,      |
|            |            | \"Usage and Usage Application          |
|            |            | Dictionaries\" for more information.   |
+------------+------------+----------------------------------------+

In its simplest form, each dictionary shall contain a **Type** entry and
a **Name** for presentation in a user interface. It may also have an
**Intent** entry that may describe its intended use (see 8.11.2.3,
\"Intent\") and a **Usage** entry that shall describe the nature of its
content (see 8.11.4.4, \"Usage and Usage Application Dictionaries\").

Individual content elements in a document may specify the optional
content group or groups that affect their visibility (see 8.11.3,
\"Making Graphical Content Optional\"). Any content whose visibility
shall be affected by a given optional content group is said to belong to
that group.

A group shall be assigned a state, which is either **ON** or **OFF**.
States themselves are not part of the PDF document but may be set
programmatically or through the reader's user interface to change the
visibility of content. When a document is first opened by a conforming
reader, the groups' states shall be initialized based on the document's
default configuration dictionary (see 8.11.4.3, \"Optional Content
Configuration Dictionaries\").

Content belonging to a group shall be visible when the group is **ON**
and invisible when it is **OFF**. Content may belong to multiple groups,
which may have conflicting states. These cases shall be described by the
use of optional content membership dictionaries, described in the next
sub-clause.

> **8.11.2.2 Optional Content Membership Dictionaries**

As mentioned above, content may belong to a single optional content
group and shall be visible when the group is **ON** and invisible when
it is **OFF**. To express more complex visibility policies, content
shall not declare itself to belong directly to an optional content group
but rather to an *optional content membership dictionary*, whose entries
are shown in Table 99.

NOTE 1 8.11.3, \"Making Graphical Content Optional\" describes how
content declares its membership in a group or membership dictionary.

+----------+------------+-----------------------------------------+
| **VE**   | array      | *(Optional; PDF 1.6)* An array          |
|          |            | specifying a *visibility expression*,   |
|          |            | used to compute visibility of content   |
|          |            | based on a set of optional content      |
|          |            | groups; see discussion below.           |
+----------+------------+-----------------------------------------+

An optional content membership dictionary may express its visibility
policy in two ways:

- The **P** entry may specify a simple boolean expression indicating how
  the optional content groups specified by the **OCGs** entry determine
  the visibility of content controlled by the membership dictionary.

- PDF 1.6 introduced the **VE** entry, which is a visibility expression
  that may be used to specify an arbitrary boolean expression for
  computing the visibility of content from the states of optional
  content groups.

NOTE 2 Since the ***VE*** entry is more general, if it is present and
supported by the conforming reader software, it should be used in
preference to ***OCGs*** and ***P***. However, for compatibility
purposes, conforming writers should use ***OCGs*** and ***P*** entries
where possible. When the use of ***VE*** is necessary to express the
intended behaviour, ***OCGs*** and ***P*** entries should also be
provided to approximate the behaviour in non-conforming reader software.

A visibility expression is an array with the following characteristics:

- Its first element shall be a name representing a boolean operator
  (**And**, **Or**, or **Not**).

- Subsequent elements shall be either optional content groups or other
  visibility expressions.

- If the first element is **Not**, it shall have only one subsequent
  element. If the first element is **And** or **Or**, it shall have one
  or more subsequent elements.

- In evaluating a visibility expression, the **ON** state of an optional
  content group shall be equated to the boolean value **true**; **OFF**
  shall be equated to **false**.

Membership dictionaries are useful in cases such as these:

- Some content may choose to be *invisible* when a group is **ON** and
  *visible* when it is **OFF**. In this case, the content would belong
  to a membership dictionary whose **OCGs** entry consists of a single
  optional content group and whose **P** entry is **AnyOff** or
  **AllOff**.

NOTE 3 It is legal to have an ***OCGs*** entry consisting of a single
group and a *P* entry that is ***AnyOn*** or ***AllOn***. However, in
this case it is preferable to use an optional content group directly
because it uses fewer objects.

- Some content may belong to more than one group and needs to specify
  its policy when the groups are in conflicting states. In this case,
  the content would belong to a membership dictionary whose **OCGs**
  entry consists of an array of optional content groups and whose **P**
  entry specifies the visibility policy, as illustrated in EXAMPLE 1 in
  this sub-clause. EXAMPLE 2 in this sub-clause shows the equivalent
  policy using visibility expressions.

> **8.11.2.3 Intent**

PDF defines two intents: *Design*, which may be used to represent a
document designer's structural organization of artwork, and *View*,
which may be used for interactive use by document consumers. A
conforming writer shall not use a value other than *Design* or *View*.

NOTE The **Intent** entry in Table 98 provides a way to distinguish
between different intended uses of optional content. For example, many
document design applications, such as CAD packages, offer layering
features for collecting groups of graphics together and selectively
hiding or viewing them for the convenience of the author. However, this
layering may be different (at a finer granularity, for example) than
would be useful to consumers of the document. Therefore, it is possible
to specify different intents for optional content groups within a single
document. A conforming reader may decide to use only groups that are of
a specific intent.

Configuration dictionaries (see 8.11.4.3, \"Optional Content
Configuration Dictionaries\") may also contain an **Intent** entry. If
one or more of a group's intents is contained in the current
configuration's set of intents, the group shall be used in determining
visibility. If there is no match, the group shall have no effect on
visibility.

If the configuration's ***Intent*** is an empty array, no groups shall
be used in determining visibility; therefore, all content shall be
considered visible.

**8.11.3 Making Graphical Content Optional**

> **8.11.3.1 General**

Graphical content in a PDF file may be made optional by specifying
membership in an optional content group or optional content membership
dictionary. Two primary mechanisms exist for defining membership:

- Sections of content streams delimited by marked-content operators may
  be made optional, as described in

> 8.11.3.2, \"Optional Content in Content Streams\".

- Form and image XObjects and annotations may be made optional in their
  entirety by means of a dictionary entry, as described in 8.11.3.3,
  \"Optional Content in XObjects and Annotations\".

When a piece of optional content in a PDF file is determined that it
shall be hidden, the following occurs:

- The content shall not be drawn.

- Graphics state operations, such as setting the colour, transformation
  matrix, and clipping, shall still be applied. In addition, graphics
  state side effects that arise from drawing operators shall be applied;
  in particular, the current text position shall be updated even for
  text wrapped in optional content. In other words, graphics state
  parameters that persist past the end of a marked-content section shall
  be the same whether the optional content is visible or not.

Hiding a section of optional content shall not change the colour of
objects that do not belong to the same optional content group.

- This rule shall also apply to operators that set state that is not
  strictly graphics state; for example, **BX** and **EX**.

- Objects such as form XObjects and annotations that have been made
  optional may be skipped entirely, because their contents are
  encapsulated such that no changes to the graphics state (or other
  state) persist beyond the processing of their content stream.

Other features in conforming readers, such as searching and editing, may
be affected by the ability to selectively show or hide content. A
conforming reader may choose whether to use the document's current state
of optional content groups (and, correspondingly, the document's visible
graphics) or to supply their own states of optional content groups to
control the graphics they process.

NOTE 4 Tools to select and move annotations should honour the current
on-screen visibility of annotations when performing cursor tracking and
mouse-click processing. A full text search engine, however, may need to

> process all content in a document, regardless of its current
> visibility on-screen. Export filters might choose the current
> on-screen visibility, the full content, or present the user with a
> selection of OCGs to control visibility.

NOTE 5 A non-conforming reader that does not support optional content,
such as one that only supports PDF 1.4 functionality, will draw and
process all content in a document.

> **8.11.3.2 Optional Content in Content Streams**

Sections of content in a content stream (including a page\'s
**Contents** stream, a form or pattern's content stream, glyph
descriptions a Type 3 font as specified by its **CharProcs** entry, or
an annotation's appearance) may be made optional by enclosing them
between the marked-content operators **BDC** and **EMC** (see 14.6,
\"Marked Content\") with a marked-content tag of OC. In addition, a
**DP** marked-content operator may be placed in a page's content stream
to force a reference to an optional content group or groups on the page,
even when the page has no current content in that layer.

The property list associated with the marked content shall specify
either an optional content group or optional content membership
dictionary to which the content belongs. Because a group shall be an
indirect object and a membership dictionary contains references to
indirect objects, the property list shall be a named resource listed in
the **Properties** subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see
14.6.2, \"Property Lists\"), as shown in EXAMPLE 1 and EXAMPLE 2 in this
sub-clause.

Although the marked-content tag shall be *OC*, other applications of
marked content are not precluded from using *OC* as a tag. The marked
content shall be considered to be for optional content only if the tag
is *OC* and the dictionary operand is a valid optional content group or
optional content membership dictionary.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | To avoid conflict with other features that used marked    |
| 1    | content (such as logical structure; see 14.7, \"Logical   |
|      | Structure\"), the following strategy is recommended:      |
|      |                                                           |
|      | Where content is to be tagged with optional content       |
|      | markers as well as other markers, the optional content    |
|      | markers should be nested inside the other marked content. |
|      |                                                           |
|      | Where optional content and the other markers would        |
|      | overlap but there is not strict containment, the optional |
|      | content should be broken up into two or more **BDC/EMC**  |
|      | sections, nesting the optional content sections inside    |
|      | the others as necessary. Breaking up optional content     |
|      | spans does not damage the nature of the visibility of the |
|      | content, whereas the same guarantee cannot be made for    |
|      | all other uses of marked content.                         |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | Any marked content tagged for optional content that is    |
| 2    | nested inside other marked content tagged for optional    |
|      | content is visible only if all the levels indicate        |
|      | visibility. In other words, if the settings that apply to |
|      | the outer level indicate that the content should be       |
|      | hidden, the inner level is hidden regardless of its       |
|      | settings.                                                 |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

In the following example, the state of the Show Greeting optional
content group directly controls the visibility of the text string
"Hello" on the page. When the group is **ON**, the text shall be
visible; when the group is **OFF**, the text shall be hidden.

The example above shows one piece of content associated with one
optional content group. There are other possibilities:

- More than one section of content may refer to the same group or
  membership dictionary, in which case the visibility of both sections
  is always the same.

- Equivalently, although less space-efficient, different sections may
  have separate membership dictionaries with the same **OCGs** and **P**
  entries. The sections shall have identical visibility behaviour.

- Two sections of content may belong to membership dictionaries that
  refer to the same group(s) but with different **P** settings. For
  example, if one section has no **P** entry, and the other has a **P**
  entry of **AllOff**, the visibility of the two sections of content
  shall be opposite. That is, the first section shall be visible when
  the second is hidden, and vice versa.

The following example demonstrates both the direct use of optional
content groups and the indirect use of groups through a membership
dictionary. The content (a black rectangle frame) is drawn if either of
the images controlled by the groups named Image A or Image B is shown.
If both groups are hidden, the rectangle frame shall be hidden.

> **8.11.3.3 Optional Content in XObjects and Annotations**

In addition to marked content within content streams, form XObjects and
image XObjects (see 8.8, \"External Objects\") and annotations (see
12.5, \"Annotations\") may contain an **OC** entry, which shall be an
optional content group or an optional content membership dictionary.

A form or image XObject\'s visibility shall be determined by the state
of the group or those of the groups referenced by the membership
dictionary in conjunction with its **P** (or **VE**) entry, along with
the current visibility state in the context in which the XObject is
invoked (that is, whether objects are visible in the contents stream at
the place where the **Do** operation occurred).

Annotations have various flags controlling on-screen and print
visibility (see 12.5.3, \"Annotation Flags\"). If an annotation contains
an **OC** entry, it shall be visible for screen or print only if the
flags have the appropriate settings and the group or membership
dictionary indicates it shall be visible.

The **AS** entry is an *auto state* array consisting of one or more
*usage application dictionaries* that specify how conforming readers
shall automatically set the state of optional content groups based on
external factors, as discussed in the following sub-clause.

> **8.11.4.4 Usage and Usage Application Dictionaries**

Optional content groups are typically constructed to control the
visibility of graphic objects that are related in some way. Objects can
be related in several ways; for example, a group may contain content in
a particular language or content suitable for viewing at a particular
magnification.

An optional content group's usage dictionary (the value of the **Usage**
entry in an optional content group dictionary; see Table 98) shall
contain information describing the nature of the content controlled by
the group. This dictionary can contain any combination of the entries
shown in Table 102.

|                 |            | optional content group is primarily     |
|                 |            | intended. Each dictionary shall have    |
|                 |            | two required entries:                   |
|                 |            |                                         |

+-----------------+------------+-----------------------------------------+
| **PageElement** | dictionary | *(Optional)* A dictionary declaring     |
|                 |            | that the group contains a pagination    |
|                 |            | artifact. It shall contain one entry,   |
|                 |            | **Subtype**, whose value shall be a     |
|                 |            | name that is either **HF**              |
|                 |            | (header/footer), **FG** (foreground     |
|                 |            | image or graphic), **BG** (background   |
|                 |            | image or graphic), or **L** (logo).     |
+-----------------+------------+-----------------------------------------+

While the data in the usage dictionary serves as information for a
document user to examine, it may also be used by conforming readers to
automatically manipulate the state of optional content groups based on
external factors such as current system language settings or zoom level.
Document authors may use *usage application dictionaries* to specify
which entries in the usage dictionary shall be consulted to
automatically set the state of optional content groups based on such
factors. Usage application dictionaries shall be listed in the **AS**
entry in an optional content configuration dictionary (see Table 101).
If no **AS** entry is present, states shall not be automatically
adjusted based on usage information.

A usage application dictionary specifies the rules for which usage
entries shall be used by conforming readers to automatically manipulate
the state of optional content groups, which groups shall be affected,
and under which circumstances. Table 103 shows the entries in a usage
application dictionary.

Usage application dictionaries shall only be used by interactive
conforming readers, and shall not be used by applications that use PDF
as final form output (see 8.11.4.5, \"Determining the State of Optional
Content Groups\" for more information).

|              |          | in the group's usage dictionary shall  |
|              |          | be considered.                         |
+--------------+----------+----------------------------------------+

The **Event** entry specifies whether the usage settings shall be
applied during viewing, printing, or exporting the document. The
**OCGs** entry specifies the set of optional content groups to which
usage settings shall be applied. For each of the groups in **OCGs**, the
entries in its usage dictionary (see Table 102) specified by
**Category** shall be examined to yield a *recommended state* for the
group. If all the entries yield a recommended state of **ON**, the
group's state shall be set to **ON**; otherwise, its state shall be set
to **OFF**.

The entries in the usage dictionary shall be used as follows:

- **View**: The state shall be the value of the **ViewState** entry.
  This entry allows a document to contain content that is relevant only
  when the document is viewed interactively, such as instructions for
  how to interact with the document.

- **Print**: The state shall be the value of the **PrintState** entry.
  If **PrintState** is not present, the state of the optional content
  group shall be left unchanged.

- **Export**: The state shall be the value of the **ExportState** entry.

- **Zoom**: If the current magnification level of the document is
  greater than or equal to **min** and less than **max**, the **ON**
  state shall be used; otherwise, **OFF** shall be used.

- **User**: The **Name** entry shall specify a name or names to match
  with the user's identification. The **Type** entry determines how the
  **Name** entry shall be interpreted (name, title, or organization). If
  there is an exact match, the **ON** state shall be used; otherwise
  **OFF** shall be used.

- **Language**: This category shall allow the selection of content based
  on the language and locale of the application. If an exact match to
  the language and locale is found among the **Lang** entries of the
  optional content groups in the usage application dictionary's **OCGs**
  list, all groups that have exact matches shall receive an **ON**
  recommendation. If no exact match is found, but a partial match is
  found (that is, the language matches but not the locale), all
  partially matching groups that have **Preferred** entries with a value
  of **ON** shall receive an **ON** recommendation. All other groups
  shall receive an **OFF** recommendation.

There shall be no restriction on multiple entries with the same value of
***Event***, in order to allow documents with incompatible usage
application dictionaries to be combined into larger documents and have
their behaviour preserved. If a given optional content group appears in
more than one ***OCGs*** array, its state shall be ***ON*** only if all
categories in all the usage application dictionaries it appears in shall
have a state of ***ON***.

EXAMPLE This example shows the use of an auto state array with usage
application dictionaries. The **AS** entry in the default configuration
dictionary is an array of three usage application dictionaries, one for
each of the **Event** values **View**, **Print**, and **Export**.

In the example, the usage application dictionary with event type
**View** specifies that all optional content groups shall have their
states managed based on zoom level when viewing. Three groups (objects
1, 2, and 3) contain **Zoom** usage information. Object 4 has none;
therefore, it shall not be affected by zoom level changes. Object 3
shall receive an **OFF** recommendation when exporting. When printing or
exporting, object 4 shall receive an **ON** recommendation.

> **8.11.4.5 Determining the State of Optional Content Groups**

This sub-clause summarizes the rules by which conforming readers make
use of the configuration and usage application dictionaries to set the
state of optional content groups. For purposes of this discussion, it is
useful to distinguish the following types of conforming readers:

- Viewer applications which allow users to interact with the document in
  various ways.

- Design applications, which offer layering features for collecting
  groups of graphics together and selectively hiding or viewing them.

NOTE 1 The following rules are not meant to apply to design
applications; they may manage their states in an entirely different
manner if they choose.

- Aggregating applications, which import PDF files as graphics.

- Printing applications, which print PDF files.

When a document is first opened, its optional content groups shall be
assigned a state based on the **D** (default) configuration dictionary
in the **OCProperties** dictionary:

a)  The value of **BaseState** shall be applied to all the groups.

b)  The groups listed in either the **ON** or **OFF** array (depending
    on which one is opposite to **BaseState**) shall have their states
    adjusted.

This state shall be the state used by printing and aggregating
application. Such applications shall not apply the changes based on
usage application dictionaries described below. However, for more
advanced functionality, they may provide user control for manipulating
the individual states of optional content groups.

NOTE 2 Viewer applications may also provide users with an option to view
documents in this state (that is, to disable the automatic adjustments
discussed below). This option permits an accurate preview of the content
as it will appear when placed into an aggregating application or sent to
a stand-alone printing system.

The remaining discussion in this sub-clause applies only to viewer
applications. Such applications shall examine the **AS** array for usage
application dictionaries that have an **Event** of type **View**. For
each one found, the groups listed in its **OCGs** array shall be
adjusted as described in 8.11.4.4, \"Usage and Usage Application
Dictionaries\".

Subsequently, the document is ready for interactive viewing by a user.
Whenever there is a change to a factor that the usage application
dictionaries with event type **View** depend on (such as zoom level),
the corresponding dictionaries shall be reapplied.

The user may manipulate optional content group states manually or by
triggering **SetOCGState** actions (see 12.6.4.12, \"Set-OCG-State
Actions\") by, for example, clicking links or bookmarks. Manual changes
shall override the states that were set automatically. The states of
these groups remain overridden and shall not be readjusted based on
usage application dictionaries with event type **View** as long as the
document is open (or until the user reverts the document to its original
state).

When a document is printed by a viewer application, usage application
dictionaries with an event type **Print** shall be applied over the
current states of optional content groups. These changes shall persist
only for the duration of the print operation; then all groups shall
revert to their prior states.

Similarly, when a document is exported to a format that does not support
optional content, usage application dictionaries with an event type
**Export** shall be applied over the current states of optional content
groups. Changes shall persist only for the duration of the export
operation; then all groups shall revert to their prior states.

NOTE 3 Although the event types ***Print*** and ***Export*** have
identically named counterparts that are usage categories, the
corresponding usage application dictionaries are permitted to specify
that other categories may be applied.

##  9 Text

###  9.1 General

This clause describes the special facilities in PDF for dealing with
text---specifically, for representing characters with glyphs from fonts.
A glyph is a graphical shape and is subject to all graphical
manipulations, such as coordinate transformation. Because of the
importance of text in most page descriptions, PDF provides higherlevel
facilities to describe, select, and render glyphs conveniently and
efficiently.

The first sub-clause is a general description of how glyphs from fonts
are painted on the page. Subsequent sub-clauses cover these topics in
detail:

- *Text state*. A subset of the graphics state parameters pertain to
  text, including parameters that select the font, scale the glyphs to
  an appropriate size, and accomplish other graphical effects.

- *Text objects and operators*. The text operators specify the glyphs to
  be painted, represented by string objects whose values shall be
  interpreted as sequences of character codes. A text object encloses a
  sequence of text operators and associated parameters.

- *Font data structures*. Font dictionaries and associated data
  structures provide information that a conforming reader needs to
  interpret the text and position the glyphs properly. The definitions
  of the glyphs themselves shall be contained in *font programs*, which
  may be embedded in the PDF file, built into a conforming reader, or
  obtained from an external font file.

###  9.2 Organization and Use of Fonts

**9.2.1 General**

A *character* is an abstract symbol, whereas a *glyph* is a specific
graphical rendering of a character.

EXAMPLE 1 The glyphs A, **A**, and *A* are renderings of the abstract
"A" character.

NOTE 1 Historically these two terms have often been used interchangeably
in computer typography (as evidenced by the names chosen for some PDF
dictionary keys and PostScript operators), but advances in this area
have made the distinction more meaningful. Consequently, this standard
distinguishes between characters and glyphs, though with some residual
names that are inconsistent.

Glyphs are organized into fonts*.* A *font* defines glyphs for a
particular character set.

EXAMPLE 2 The Helvetica and Times fonts define glyphs for a set of
standard Latin characters.

A font for use with a conforming reader is prepared in the form of a
program. Such a *font program* shall be written in a special-purpose
language, such as the *Type 1*, *TrueType*, or *OpenType* font format,
that is understood by a specialized font interpreter.

In PDF, the term *font* refers to a *font dictionary*, a PDF object that
identifies the font program and contains additional information about
it. There are several different font types, identified by the
**Subtype** entry of the font dictionary.

For most font types, the font program shall be defined in a separate
*font file*, which may be either embedded in a PDF stream object or
obtained from an external source. The font program contains *glyph
descriptions* that generate glyphs.

A content stream paints glyphs on the page by specifying a font
dictionary and a string object that shall be interpreted as a sequence
of one or more character codes identifying glyphs in the font. This
operation is called *showing* the text string; the text strings drawn in
this way are called *show strings*. The glyph description consists of a
sequence of graphics operators that produce the specific shape for that
character in this font. To render a glyph, the conforming reader
executes the glyph description.

NOTE 2 Programmers who have experience with scan conversion of general
shapes may be concerned about the amount of computation that this
description seems to imply. However, this is only the abstract behaviour
of glyph descriptions and font programs, not how they are implemented.
In fact, an efficient implementation can be achieved through careful
caching and reuse of previously rendered glyphs.

**9.2.2 Basics of Showing Text**

EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the most straightforward use of a
font. The text ABC is placed 10 inches from the bottom of the page and 4
inches from the left edge, using 12-point Helvetica.

> BT
>
> /F13 12 Tf
>
> 288 720 Td
>
> ( ABC ) Tj ET
>
> The five lines of this example perform these steps:

a)  Begin a text object.

b)  Set the font and font size to use, installing them as parameters in
    the text state. In this case, the font resource identified by the
    name F13 specifies the font externally known as Helvetica.

c)  Specify a starting position on the page, setting parameters in the
    text object.

d)  Paint the glyphs for a string of characters at that position.

e)  End the text object.

These paragraphs explain these operations in more detail.

To paint glyphs, a content stream shall first identify the font to be
used. The **Tf** operator shall specify the name of a font
resource---that is, an entry in the **Font** subdictionary of the
current resource dictionary. The value of that entry shall be a font
dictionary. The font dictionary shall identify the font's externally
known name, such as Helvetica, and shall supply some additional
information that the conforming reader needs to paint glyphs from that
font. The font dictionary may provide the definition of the font program
itself.

NOTE 1 The font resource name presented to the ***Tf*** operator is
arbitrary, as are the names for all kinds of resources. It bears no
relationship to an actual font name, such as Helvetica.

EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates an excerpt from the current page's
resource dictionary, which defines the font dictionary that is
referenced as F13 (see EXAMPLE 1 in this sub-clause).

> /Resources
>
> \<\< /Font \<\< /F13 23 0 R \>\>
>
> \>\>
>
> 23 0 obj
>
> \<\< /Type /Font
>
> /Subtype /Type1
>
> /BaseFont /Helvetica
>
> \>\> endobj

A font defines the glyphs at one standard size. This standard is
arranged so that the nominal height of tightly spaced lines of text is 1
unit. In the default user coordinate system, this means the standard
glyph size is 1 unit in user space, or 1 ⁄ 72 inch. Starting with PDF
1.6, the size of this unit may be specified as greater than 1 ⁄ 72 inch
by means of the **UserUnit** entry of the page dictionary; see Table 30.
The standard-size font shall then be scaled to be usable. The scale
factor is specified as the second operand of the **Tf** operator,
thereby setting the *text font size* parameter in the graphics state.
EXAMPLE 1 in this sub-clause establishes the Helvetica font with a
12-unit size in the graphics state.

Once the font has been selected and scaled, it may be used to paint
glyphs. The **Td** operator shall adjust the translation components of
the text matrix, as described in 9.4.2, \"Text-Positioning Operators\".
When executed for the first time after **BT**, **Td** shall establish
the text position in the current user coordinate system. This determines
the position on the page at which to begin painting glyphs.

The **Tj** operator shall take a string operand and shall paint the
corresponding glyphs, using the current font and other text-related
parameters in the graphics state.

NOTE 2 The **Tj** operator treats each element of the string (an integer
in the range 0 to 255) as a character code (see EXAMPLE 1 in this
sub-clause).

Each byte shall select a glyph description in the font, and the glyph
description shall be executed to paint that glyph on the page. This is
the behaviour of **Tj** for simple fonts, such as ordinary Latin text
fonts. Interpretation of the string as a sequence of character codes is
more complex for composite fonts, described in 9.7, \"Composite Fonts\".

What these steps produce on the page is not a 12-*point* glyph, but
rather a 12-*unit* glyph, where the unit size shall be that of the text
space at the time the glyphs are rendered on the page. The actual size
of the glyph shall be determined by the text matrix (*T*~m~ ) in the
text object, several text state parameters, and the current
transformation matrix (CTM) in the graphics state; see 9.4.4, \"Text
Space Details\".

EXAMPLE 3 If the text space is later scaled to make the unit size 1
centimeter, painting glyphs from the same 12-unit font generates results
that are 12 centimeters high.

**9.2.3 Achieving Special Graphical Effects**

Normal uses of **Tj** and other glyph-painting operators cause
black-filled glyphs to be painted. Other effects may be obtained by
combining font operators with general graphics operators.

The colour used for painting glyphs shall be the current colour in the
graphics state: either the nonstroking colour or the stroking colour (or
both), depending on the text rendering mode (see 9.3.6, \"Text Rendering
Mode\"). The default colour shall be black (in DeviceGray), but other
colours may be obtained by executing an appropriate colour-setting
operator or operators (see 8.6.8, \"Colour Operators\") before painting
the glyphs.

EXAMPLE 1 This example uses text rendering mode 0 and the g operator to
fill glyphs in 50 percent gray, as shown in Figure 36.

Other graphical effects may be achieved by treating the glyph outline as
a path instead of filling it. The *text rendering mode* parameter in the
graphics state specifies whether glyph outlines shall be filled,
stroked, used as a clipping boundary, or some combination of these
effects. Only a subset of the possible rendering modes apply to Type 3
fonts.

EXAMPLE 2 This example treats glyph outlines as a path to be stroked.
The Tr operator sets the text rendering mode to 1 (stroke). The w
operator sets the line width to 2 units in user space. Given those
graphics state parameters, the Tj operator strokes the glyph outlines
with a line 2 points thick (see Figure 37).

EXAMPLE 3 This example illustrates how the glyphs' outlines may be used
as a clipping boundary. The **Tr** operator sets the text rendering mode
to 7 (clip), causing the subsequent **Tj** operator to impose the glyph
outlines as the current clipping path. All subsequent painting
operations mark the page only within this path, as illustrated in Figure
38. This state persists until an earlier clipping path is reinstated by
the **Q** operator.

**9.2.4 Glyph Positioning and Metrics**

A glyph's *width*---formally, its *horizontal displacement*---is the
amount of space it occupies along the baseline of a line of text that is
written horizontally. In other words, it is the distance the current
text position shall move (by translating text space) when the glyph is
painted.

NOTE 1 The width is distinct from the dimensions of the glyph outline.

In some fonts, the width is constant; it does not vary from glyph to
glyph. Such fonts are called *fixed-pitch* or *monospaced*. They are
used mainly for typewriter-style printing. However, most fonts used for
high-quality typography associate a different width with each glyph.
Such fonts are called *proportional* or *variable-pitch* fonts. In
either case, the **Tj** operator shall position the consecutive glyphs
of a string according to their widths.

The width information for each glyph shall be stored both in the font
dictionary and in the font program itself. The two sets of widths shall
be identical.

NOTE 2 Storing this information in the font dictionary, although
redundant, enables a conforming reader to determine glyph positioning
without having to look inside the font program.

NOTE 3 The operators for showing text are designed on the assumption
that glyphs are ordinarily positioned according to their standard
widths. However, means are provided to vary the positioning in certain
limited ways. For example, the TJ operator enables the text position to
be adjusted between any consecutive pair of glyphs corresponding to
characters in a text string. There are graphics state parameters to
adjust character and word spacing systematically.

In addition to width, a glyph has several other metrics that influence
glyph positioning and painting. For most font types, this information is
largely internal to the font program and is not specified explicitly in
the PDF font dictionary. However, in a Type 3 font, all metrics are
specified explicitly (see 9.6.5, \"Type 3 Fonts\").

The *glyph coordinate system* is the space in which an individual
character's glyph is defined. All path coordinates and metrics shall be
interpreted in glyph space. For all font types except Type 3, the units
of glyph space are one-thousandth of a unit of text space; for a Type 3
font, the transformation from glyph space to text space shall be defined
by a *font matrix* specified in an explicit **FontMatrix** entry in the
font. Figure 39 shows a typical glyph outline and its metrics.

> **Figure 39 -- Glyph metrics**

The *glyph* *origin* is the point (0, 0) in the glyph coordinate system.
**Tj** and other text-showing operators shall position the origin of the
first glyph to be painted at the origin of text space.

EXAMPLE 1 This code adjusts the origin of text space to (40, 50) in the
user coordinate system and then places the origin of the A glyph at that
point:

> BT
>
> 40 50 Td
>
> ( ABC ) Tj
>
> ET

The *glyph* *displacement* is the distance from the glyph's origin to
the point at which the origin of the *next* glyph should normally be
placed when painting the consecutive glyphs of a line of text. This
distance is a vector (called the *displacement vector*) in the glyph
coordinate system; it has horizontal and vertical components.

NOTE 4 Most Western writing systems, including those based on the Latin
alphabet, have a positive horizontal displacement and a zero vertical
displacement. Some Asian writing systems have a nonzero vertical
displacement. In all cases, the text-showing operators transform the
displacement vector into text space and then translate text space by
that amount.

The *glyph bounding box* shall be the smallest rectangle (oriented with
the axes of the glyph coordinate system) that just encloses the entire
glyph shape. The bounding box shall be expressed in terms of its left,
bottom, right, and top coordinates relative to the glyph origin in the
glyph coordinate system.

In some writing systems, text is frequently aligned in two different
directions.

NOTE 5 It is common to write Japanese and Chinese glyphs either
horizontally or vertically.

To handle this, a font may contain a second set of metrics for each
glyph. Which set of metrics to use shall be selected according to a
*writing mode*, where 0 shall specify horizontal writing and 1 shall
specify vertical writing. This feature is available only for composite
fonts, discussed in 9.7, \"Composite Fonts\".

When a glyph has two sets of metrics, each set shall specify a glyph
origin and a displacement vector for that writing mode. In vertical
writing, the glyph position shall be described by a *position vector*
from the origin used for horizontal writing (origin 0) to the origin
used for vertical writing (origin 1). Figure 40 illustrates the metrics
for the two writing modes:

- The left diagram illustrates the glyph metrics associated with writing
  mode 0, horizontal writing. The coordinates *ll* and *ur* specify the
  bounding box of the glyph relative to origin 0. *w0* is the
  displacement vector that specifies how the text position shall be
  changed after the glyph is painted in writing mode 0; its vertical
  component shall be 0.

- The center diagram illustrates writing mode 1, vertical writing. *w1*
  shall be the displacement vector for writing mode 1; its horizontal
  component shall be 0.

- In the right diagram, *v* is a position vector defining the position
  of origin 1 relative to origin 0.

> **Figure 40 -- Metrics for horizontal and vertical writing modes**

##  9.3 Text State Parameters and Operators

**9.3.1 General**

The *text state* comprises those graphics state parameters that only
affect text. There are nine parameters in the text state (see Table
104).

> **Table 104 -- Text state parameters**

  --------------------------------------------------
  **Parameter**   **Description**
  --------------- ----------------------------------
  *T*~c~          Character spacing

  *T*~w~          Word spacing

  *T*h            Horizontal scaling

  *T*~l~          Leading

  *T*~f~          Text font

  *T*fs           Text font size

  *^T^*mode       Text rendering mode

  *^T^*rise       Text rise

  *T*~k~          Text knockout
  --------------------------------------------------

Except for the previously described *T*~f~ and *T*~fs~ , these
parameters are discussed further in subsequent subclauses. (As described
in 9.4, \"Text Objects\", three additional text-related parameters may
occur only within a text object: *T*~m~ , the text matrix; *T*~lm~ , the
text line matrix; and *T*~rm~ , the text rendering matrix.) The values
of the text state parameters shall be consulted when text is positioned
and shown (using the operators described in 9.4.2, \"Text-Positioning
Operators\" and 9.4.3, \"Text-Showing Operators\"). In particular, the
spacing and scaling parameters shall be used in a computation described
in 9.4.4, \"Text Space Details\". The text state parameters may be set
using the operators listed in Table 105.

The text knockout parameter, T~k~ , shall be set through the ***TK***
entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary by using the ***gs***
operator (see 8.4.5, \"Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries\"). There
is no specific operator for setting this parameter.

The text state operators may appear outside text objects, and the values
they set are retained across text objects in a single content stream.
Like other graphics state parameters, these parameters shall be
initialized to their default values at the beginning of each page.

> **Table 105 -- Text state operators**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Operands**   **Operator**   **Description**
  -------------- -------------- -----------------------------------------
  *charSpace*    **Tc**         Set the character spacing, *T*~c~ , to
                                *charSpace*, which shall be a number
                                expressed in unscaled text space units.
                                Character spacing shall be used by the
                                **Tj**, **TJ**, and **\'** operators.
                                Initial value: 0.

  *wordSpace*    **Tw**         Set the word spacing, *T*~w~ , to
                                *wordSpace*, which shall be a number
                                expressed in unscaled text space units.
                                Word spacing shall be used by the **Tj**,
                                **TJ**, and **\'** operators. Initial
                                value: 0.

  *scale*        **Tz**         Set the horizontal scaling, *T*~h~ , to
                                (*scale* ÷ 100). *scale* shall be a
                                number specifying the percentage of the
                                normal width. Initial value: 100 (normal
                                width).

|              |                | subdictionary of the current resource  |
|              |                | dictionary; *size* shall be a number   |
|              |                | representing a scale factor. There is  |

|              |                | *size*; they shall be specified        |
|              |                | explicitly by using **Tf** before any  |
|              |                | text is shown.                         |
+--------------+----------------+----------------------------------------+
| *render*     | **Tr**         | Set the text rendering mode, *T*~mode~ |
|              |                | , to *render*, which shall be an       |
|              |                | integer. Initial value: 0.             |
+--------------+----------------+----------------------------------------+
| *rise*       | **Ts**         | Set the text rise, *T*~rise~ , to      |
|              |                | *rise*, which shall be a number        |
|              |                | expressed in unscaled text space       |
|              |                | units. Initial value: 0.               |
+--------------+----------------+----------------------------------------+

Some of these parameters are expressed in *unscaled* text space units.
This means that they shall be specified in a coordinate system that
shall be defined by the text matrix, *T*~m~ but shall not be scaled by
the font size parameter, *^T^*~fs~ .

**9.3.2 Character Spacing**

The character-spacing parameter, *T*~c~ , shall be a number specified in
unscaled text space units (although it shall be subject to scaling by
the *T*~h~ parameter if the writing mode is horizontal). When the glyph
for each character in the string is rendered, *T*~c~ shall be *added* to
the horizontal or vertical component of the glyph's displacement,
depending on the writing mode. See 9.2.4, \"Glyph Positioning and
Metrics\", for a discussion of glyph displacements. In the default
coordinate system, horizontal coordinates increase from left to right
and vertical coordinates from bottom to top. Therefore, for horizontal
writing, a positive value of *T*~c~ has the effect of expanding the
distance between glyphs (see Figure 41), whereas for vertical writing, a
*negative* value of *T*~c~ has this effect.

+-----------+---------------------------------+
| *T~c~* =  | Character                       |
| 0         |                                 |
| (default) |                                 |
+:==========+:================================+
| > *T~c~*  | C h a r a c t e r               |

+-----------+---------------------------------+

> **Figure 41 -- Character spacing in horizontal writing**

**9.3.3 Word Spacing**

Word spacing works the same way as character spacing but shall apply
only to the ASCII SPACE character

(20h). The word-spacing parameter, *T*~w~ , shall be added to the
glyph's horizontal or vertical displacement (depending on the writing
mode). For horizontal writing, a positive value for *T*~w~ has the
effect of increasing the spacing between words. For vertical writing, a
positive value for *T*~w~ *decreases* the spacing between words (and a
negative value increases it), since vertical coordinates increase from
bottom to top. Figure 42 illustrates the effect of word spacing in
horizontal writing.

+-------------+---------------------------------+
| > *T~w~* =  | Word Space                      |
| > 0         |                                 |
| > (default) |                                 |
+:============+=================================+
| > *T~w~* =  | Word Space                      |
| > 2.5       |                                 |
+-------------+---------------------------------+

> **Figure 42 -- Word spacing in horizontal writing**

Word spacing shall be applied to every occurrence of the single-byte
character code 32 in a string when using a simple font or a composite
font that defines code 32 as a single-byte code. It shall not apply to
occurrences of the byte value 32 in multiple-byte codes.

**9.3.4 Horizontal Scaling**

The horizontal scaling parameter, *T*~h~ , adjusts the width of glyphs
by stretching or compressing them in the horizontal direction. Its value
shall be specified as a percentage of the normal width of the glyphs,
with 100 being the normal width. The scaling shall apply to the
horizontal coordinate in text space, independently of the writing mode.
It shall affect both the glyph's shape and its horizontal displacement
(that is, its displacement vector). If the writing mode is horizontal,
it shall also effect the spacing parameters *T*~c~ and *T*~w~ , as well
as any positioning adjustments performed by the **TJ** operator. Figure
43 shows the effect of horizontal scaling.

> **Figure 43 -- Horizontal scaling**

**9.3.5 Leading**

The leading parameter, *T*~l~ , shall be specified in unscaled text
space units . It specifies the vertical distance between the baselines
of adjacent lines of text, as shown in Figure 44.

+---------------------------------------------+
| This is 12-point text with                  |
|                                             |
| 14.5-point leading                          |
|                                             |
| > Leading                                   |
+=============================================+

> **Figure 44 -- Leading**

The leading parameter shall be used by the **TD**, **T\***, **\'**, and
**\"** operators; see Table 108 for a precise description of its
effects. This parameter shall apply to the vertical coordinate in text
space, independently of the writing mode.

**9.3.6 Text Rendering Mode**

The text rendering mode, *T*~mode~ , determines whether showing text
shall cause glyph outlines to be stroked, filled, used as a clipping
boundary, or some combination of the three. Stroking, filling, and
clipping shall have the same effects for a text object as they do for a
path object (see 8.5.3, \"Path-Painting Operators\" and 8.5.4,
\"Clipping Path Operators\"), although they are specified in an entirely
different way. The graphics state parameters affecting those operations,
such as line width, shall be interpreted in user space rather than in
text space.

NOTE The text rendering modes are shown in Table 106. In the examples, a
stroke colour of black and a fill colour of light gray are used. For the
clipping modes (4 to 7), a series of lines has been drawn through the
glyphs to show where the clipping occurs.

Only a value of 3 for text rendering mode shall have any effect on text
displayed in a Type 3 font (see 9.6.5, \"Type 3 Fonts\").

If the text rendering mode calls for filling, the current nonstroking
colour in the graphics state shall be used; if it calls for stroking,
the current stroking colour shall be used. In modes that perform both
filling and stroking, the effect shall be as if each glyph outline were
filled and then stroked in separate operations. If any of the glyphs
overlap, the result shall be equivalent to filling and stroking them one
at a time, producing the appearance of stacked opaque glyphs, rather
than first filling and then stroking them all at once. In the
transparent imaging model, these combined filling and stroking modes
shall be subject to further considerations; see 11.7.4.4, \"Special
Path-Painting Considerations\".

The behaviour of the clipping modes requires further explanation. Glyph
outlines shall begin accumulating if a **BT** operator is executed while
the text rendering mode is set to a clipping mode or if it is set to a
clipping mode within a text object. Glyphs shall accumulate until the
text object is ended by an **ET** operator; the text rendering mode
shall not be changed back to a nonclipping mode before that point.

+------------+---------------+--------------------------+

At the end of the text object, the accumulated glyph outlines, if any,
shall be combined into a single path, treating the individual outlines
as subpaths of that path and applying the nonzero winding number rule
(see 8.5.3.3.2, \"Nonzero Winding Number Rule\"). The current clipping
path in the graphics state shall be set to the intersection of this path
with the previous clipping path. As is the case for path objects, this
clipping shall occur *after* all filling and stroking operations for the
text object have occurred. It remains in effect until a previous
clipping path is restored by an invocation of the **Q** operator.

If no glyphs are shown or if the only glyphs shown have no outlines (for
example, if they are ASCII SPACE characters (20h)), no clipping shall
occur.

**9.3.7 Text Rise**

Text rise, *T*~rise~ , shall specify the distance, in unscaled text
space units, to move the baseline up or down from its default location.
Positive values of text rise shall move the baseline up. Figure 45
illustrates the effect of the text rise. Text rise shall apply to the
vertical coordinate in text space, regardless of the writing mode.

NOTE Adjustments to the baseline are useful for drawing superscripts or
subscripts. The default location of the baseline can be restored by
setting the text rise to 0.

**9.3.8 Text Knockout**

The text knockout parameter, *T*~k~ *(PDF 1.4)*, shall be a boolean
value that determines what text elements shall be considered elementary
objects for purposes of colour compositing in the transparent imaging
model. Unlike other text state parameters, there is no specific operator
for setting this parameter; it may be set only through the **TK** entry
in a graphics state parameter dictionary by using the **gs** operator
(see 8.4.5, \"Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries\"). The text
knockout parameter shall apply only to entire text objects; it shall not
be set between the **BT** and **ET** operators delimiting a text object.
Its initial value shall be **true**.

If the parameter is **false**, each glyph in a text object shall be
treated as a separate elementary object; when glyphs overlap, they shall
composite with one another.

If the parameter is **true**, all glyphs in the text object shall be
treated together as a single elementary object; when glyphs overlap,
later glyphs shall overwrite ("knock out") earlier ones in the area of
overlap. This behaviour is equivalent to treating the entire text object
as if it were a non-isolated knockout transparency group; see 11.4.6,
\"Knockout Groups\". Transparency parameters shall be applied to the
glyphs individually rather than to the implicit transparency group as a
whole:

- Graphics state parameters, including transparency parameters, shall be
  inherited from the context in which the text object appears. They
  shall not be saved and restored. The transparency parameters shall not
  be reset at the beginning of the transparency group (as they are when
  a transparency group XObject is explicitly invoked). Changes made to
  graphics state parameters within the text object shall persist beyond
  the end of the text object.

- After the implicit transparency group for the text object has been
  completely evaluated, the group results shall be composited with the
  backdrop, using the **Normal** blend mode and alpha and soft mask
  values of 1.0.

## 9.4 Text Objects

**9.4.1 General**

A PDF *text object* consists of operators that may show text strings,
move the text position, and set text state and certain other parameters.
In addition, three parameters may be specified only within a text object
and shall not persist from one text object to the next:

- *T*~m~ , the *text matrix*

- *T*~lm~ , the *text line matrix*

- *T*~rm~ , the *text rendering matrix*, which is actually just an
  intermediate result that combines the effects of text state
  parameters, the text matrix *(T*~m~ *)*, and the current
  transformation matrix

A text object begins with the **BT** operator and ends with the **ET**
operator, as shown in the Example, and described in Table 107.

EXAMPLE **BT**

> ... *Zero or more text operators or other allowed operators* ...
>
> **ET**
>
> **Table 107 -- Text object operators**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Operands**   **Operator**   **Description**
  -------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------
  ---            **BT**         Begin a text object, initializing the text
                                matrix, *T*~m~ , and the text line matrix,
                                *T*~lm~ , to the identity matrix. Text
                                objects shall not be nested; a second
                                **BT** shall not appear before an **ET**.

  ---            **ET**         End a text object, discarding the text
                                matrix.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

These specific categories of text-related operators may appear in a text
object:

- *Text state operators*, described in 9.3, \"Text State Parameters and
  Operators\"

- *Text-positioning operators*, described in 9.4.2, \"Text-Positioning
  Operators\"

- *Text-showing operators*, described in 9.4.3, \"Text-Showing
  Operators\"

The latter two sub-clauses also provide further details about these text
object parameters. The other operators that may appear in a text object
are those related to the general graphics state, colour, and marked
content, as shown in Figure 9.

If a content stream does not contain any text, the ***Text*** procedure
set may be omitted (see 14.2, \"Procedure Sets\"). In those
circumstances, no text operators (including operators that merely set
the text state) shall be present in the content stream, since those
operators are defined in the same procedure set.

NOTE Although text objects cannot be statically nested, text might be
shown using a Type 3 font whose glyph descriptions include any graphics
objects, including another text object. Likewise, the current colour
might be a tiling pattern whose pattern cell includes a text object.

**9.4.2 Text-Positioning Operators**

*Text space* is the coordinate system in which text is shown. It shall
be defined by the text matrix, *T*~m~ , and the text state parameters
*T*~fs~ , *T*~h~ , and *T*~rise~ , which together shall determine the
transformation from text space to user space. Specifically, the origin
of the first glyph shown by a text-showing operator shall be placed at
the origin of text space. If text space has been translated, scaled, or
rotated, then the position, size, or orientation of the glyph in user
space shall be correspondingly altered.

The text-positioning operators shall only appear within text objects.

At the beginning of a text object, *T*~m~ shall be the identity matrix;
therefore, the origin of text space shall be initially the same as that
of user space. The *text-positioning operators*, described in Table 108,
alter *T*~m~ and thereby control the placement of glyphs that are
subsequently painted. Also, the *text-showing operators*, described in
Table 109, update *T*~m~ (by altering its *e* and *f* translation
components) to take into account the horizontal or vertical displacement
of each glyph painted as well as any character or word-spacing
parameters in the text state.

Additionally, within a text object, a conforming reader shall keep track
of a text line matrix, *T*lm , which captures the value of *T*~m~ at the
beginning of a line of text. The text-positioning and text-showing
operators shall read and set *T*lm on specific occasions mentioned in
Tables 108 and 109.

NOTE This can be used to compactly represent evenly spaced lines of
text.

**9.4.3 Text-Showing Operators**

The *text-showing operators* (Table 109) shall show text on the page,
repositioning text space as they do so. All of the operators shall
interpret the text string and apply the text state parameters as
described in Table 109.

The text-showing operators shall only appear within text objects.

|                 |                | or a number. If the element is a string, this operator shall    |
|                 |                | show the string. If it is a number, the operator shall adjust   |
|                 |                | the text position by that amount; that is, it shall translate   |
|                 |                | the text matrix, *^T^*~m~ . The number shall be expressed in    |
|                 |                | thousandths of a unit of text space (see 9.4.4, \"Text Space    |
|                 |                | Details\"). This amount shall be *subtracted* from the current  |
|                 |                | horizontal or vertical coordinate, depending on the writing     |
|                 |                | mode. In the default coordinate system, a positive adjustment   |
|                 |                | has the effect of moving the next glyph painted either to the   |
|                 |                | left or down by the given amount. Figure 46 shows an example of |

> **Figure 46 -- Operation of the TJ operator in horizontal writing**

A string operand of a text-showing operator shall be interpreted as a
sequence of character codes identifying the glyphs to be painted.

With a simple font, each byte of the string shall be treated as a
separate character code. The character code shall then be looked up in
the font's encoding to select the glyph, as described in 9.6.6,
\"Character Encoding\".

With a composite font *(PDF 1.2)*, multiple-byte codes may be used to
select glyphs. In this instance, one or more consecutive bytes of the
string shall be treated as a single character code. The code lengths and
the mappings from codes to glyphs are defined in a data structure called
a *CMap*, described in 9.7, \"Composite Fonts\".

The strings shall conform to the syntax for string objects. When a
string is written by enclosing the data in parentheses, bytes whose
values are equal to those of the ASCII characters LEFT PARENTHESIS
(28h), RIGHT PARENTHESIS (29h), and REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch) (backslash)
shall be preceded by a REVERSE SOLIDUS) character. All other byte values
between 0 and 255 may be used in a string object. These rules apply to
each individual byte in a string object, whether the string is
interpreted by the text-showing operators as single-byte or
multiple-byte character codes.

Strings presented to the text-showing operators may be of any
length---even a single character code per string---and may be placed on
the page in any order. The grouping of glyphs into strings has no
significance for the display of text. Showing multiple glyphs with one
invocation of a text-showing operator such as **Tj** shall produce the
same results as showing them with a separate invocation for each glyph.

NOTE 6 The performance of text searching (and other text extraction
operations) is significantly better if the text strings are as long as
possible and are shown in natural reading order.

NOTE 7 In some cases, the text that is extracted can vary depending on
the grouping of glyphs into strings. See, for example, 14.8.2.3.3,
\"Reverse-Order Show Strings\".

**9.4.4 Text Space Details**

As stated in 9.4.2, \"Text-Positioning Operators\", text shall be shown
in *text space*, defined by the combination of the text matrix, *T*~m~ ,
and the text state parameters *T*~fs~ , *T*~h~ , and *T*~rise~ . This
determines how text coordinates are transformed into user space. Both
the glyph's shape and its displacement (horizontal or vertical) shall be
interpreted in text space.

| 1    | > definition varies according to the font type as         |

> *T*rm is a temporary matrix; conceptually, it is recomputed before
> each glyph is painted during a text-showing operation.

After the glyph is painted, the text matrix shall be updated according
to the glyph displacement and any spacing parameters that apply. First,
a combined displacement shall be computed, denoted by *t*~x~ in
horizontal writing mode or *t*~y~ in vertical writing mode (the variable
corresponding to the other writing mode shall be set to 0):

⎝ ⎝ T^j\ ⎞^ × T*~fs~* + T~c~ + T~w~ ^⎞^~⎠~ × T~h~

t~x~ = ^⎛\ ⎛^*w0* -- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--1000- ~⎠~

t~y~ = ^⎛^~⎝~*w1* -- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--1000Tj - ⎞~⎠~ × T*fs* + Tc + Tw
where *w0* and *w1* denote the glyph's horizontal and vertical
displacements

> scaling parameters in the graphics state
>
> *T*~c~ and *T*~w~ denote the current character- and word-spacing

The text matrix shall then be then updated as follows:

1 0 0

T*~m~* =0 1 0× T~m~

##  9.5 Introduction to Font Data Structures

A font shall be represented in PDF as a dictionary specifying the type
of font, its PostScript name, its encoding, and information that can be
used to provide a substitute when the font program is not available.
Optionally, the font program may be embedded as a stream object in the
PDF file.

The font types are distinguished by the **Subtype** entry in the font
dictionary. Table 110 lists the font types defined in PDF. Type 0 fonts
are called *composite fonts*; other types of fonts are called *simple
fonts*. In addition to fonts, PDF supports two classes of font-related
objects, called *CIDFonts* and *CMaps*, described in 9.7.2, \"CID-Keyed
Fonts Overview\". CIDFonts are listed in Table 110 because, like fonts,
they are collections of glyphs; however, a CIDFont shall not be used
directly but only as a component of a Type 0 font.

For all font types, the term *font dictionary* refers to a PDF
dictionary containing information about the font; likewise, a *CIDFont
dictionary* contains information about a CIDFont. Except for Type 3,
this dictionary is distinct from the *font program* that defines the
font's glyphs. That font program may be embedded in the PDF file as a
stream object or be obtained from some external source.

|      | programs that are not embedded, the results depend on the |
|      | availability of fonts in the conforming reader's          |
|      | environment. The following sub-clauses specify some       |
|      | conventions for referring to external font programs.      |

## 9.6 Simple Fonts

**9.6.1 General**

There are several types of simple fonts, all of which have these
properties:

- Glyphs in the font shall be selected by single-byte character codes
  obtained from a string that is shown by the text-showing operators.
  Logically, these codes index into a table of 256 glyphs; the mapping
  from codes to glyphs is called the font's *encoding*. Under some
  circumstances, the encoding may be altered by means described in
  9.6.6, \"Character Encoding\".

- Each glyph shall have a single set of metrics, including a horizontal
  displacement or width, as described in

> 9.2.4, \"Glyph Positioning and Metrics\"; that is, simple fonts
> support only horizontal writing mode.

- Except for Type 0 fonts, Type 3 fonts in non-Tagged PDF documents, and
  certain standard Type 1 fonts, every font dictionary shall contain a
  subsidiary dictionary, the *font descriptor*, containing font-wide
  metrics and other attributes of the font; see 9.8, \"Font
  Descriptors\". Among those attributes is an optional *font file*
  stream containing the font program.

**9.6.2 Type 1 Fonts**

**9.6.2.1 General**

A Type 1 font program is a stylized PostScript program that describes
glyph shapes. It uses a compact encoding for the glyph descriptions, and
it includes hint information that enables high-quality rendering even at
small sizes and low resolutions.

NOTE 1 Details on this format are provided in a separate specification,
*Adobe Type 1 Font Format*. An alternative, more compact but
functionally equivalent representation of a Type 1 font program is
documented in Adobe Technical Note #5176, *The Compact Font Format
Specification*.

NOTE 2 Although a Type 1 font program uses PostScript language syntax,
using it does not require a full PostScript interpreter; a specialized
Type 1 font interpreter suffices.

A Type 1 font dictionary may contain the entries listed in Table 111.
Some entries are optional for the standard 14 fonts listed under
9.6.2.2, \"Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts)\", but are required
otherwise.

**9.6.2.2 Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts)**

The PostScript names of 14 Type 1 fonts, known as the *standard 14
fonts*, are as follows: Times-Roman,

Helvetica, Courier, Symbol, Times-Bold, Helvetica-Bold, Courier-Bold,
ZapfDingbats, Times-Italic, HelveticaOblique, Courier-Oblique,
Times-BoldItalic, Helvetica-BoldOblique, Courier-BoldOblique

These fonts, or their font metrics and suitable substitution fonts,
shall be available to the conforming reader.

NOTE The character sets and encodings for these fonts are listed in
Annex D. The font metrics files for the standard 14 fonts are available
from the ASN Web site (see the Bibliography). For more information on
font metrics, see Adobe Technical Note #5004, *Adobe Font Metrics File
Format Specification*.

**9.6.2.3 Multiple Master Fonts**

The *multiple master* font format is an extension of the Type 1 font
format that allows the generation of a wide variety of typeface styles
from a single font program. This is accomplished through the presence of
various design dimensions in the font.

EXAMPLE 1 Examples of design dimensions are weight (light to extra-bold)
and width (condensed to expanded).

Coordinates along these design dimensions (such as the degree of
boldness) are specified by numbers. A particular choice of numbers
selects an *instance* of the multiple master font. PDFs can contain
multiple master instances.

NOTE Adobe Technical Note #5015, *Type 1 Font Format Supplement*,
describes multiple master fonts in detail.

The font dictionary for a multiple master font instance may contain the
same entries as a Type 1 font dictionary (see Table 111), with these
differences:

- The value of **Subtype** shall be **MMType1**.

- If the PostScript name of the instance contains SPACEs (20h), the
  SPACEs shall be replaced by LOW LINEs (underscores) (5Fh) in the value
  of **BaseFont**. For instance, as illustrated in this example, the
  name "MinionMM 366 465 11 " (which ends with a SPACE character)
  becomes /MinionMM_366_465_11\_.

>
> This example illustrates a convention for including the numeric values
> of the design coordinates as part of the instance's **BaseFont** name.
> This convention is commonly used for accessing multiple master font
> instances from an external source in the conforming reader's
> environment; it is documented in Adobe Technical Note #5088, *Font
> Naming Issues*. However, this convention is not prescribed as part of
> the PDF specification.

If the font program for a multiple master font instance is embedded in
the PDF file, it shall be an ordinary Type 1 font program, not a
multiple master font program. This font program is called a *snapshot*
of the multiple master font instance that incorporates the chosen values
of the design coordinates.

**9.6.3 TrueType Fonts**

A TrueType font dictionary may contain the same entries as a Type 1 font
dictionary (see Table 111), with these differences:

- The value of **Subtype** shall be **TrueType**.

- The value of **Encoding** is subject to limitations that are described
  in 9.6.6, \"Character Encoding\".

- The value of **BaseFont** is derived differently.

The PostScript name for the value of **BaseFont** may be determined in
one of two ways:

- If the TrueType font program\'s "name" table contains a PostScript
  name, it shall be used.

- In the absence of such an entry in the "name" table, a PostScript name
  shall be derived from the name by which the font is known in the host
  operating system. On a Windows system, the name shall be based on the
  lfFaceName field in a LOGFONT structure; in the Mac OS, it shall be
  based on the name of the FOND resource. If the name contains any
  SPACEs, the SPACEs shall be removed.

+------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > The *TrueType* font format was developed by Apple        |
| 1    | > Computer, Inc., and has been adopted as a standard font  |
|      | > format for the Microsoft Windows operating system.       |
|      | > Specifications for the TrueType font file format are     |
|      | > available in Apple's *TrueType Reference Manual* and     |
|      | > Microsoft's *TrueType 1.0 Font Files Technical           |
|      | > Specification* (see Bibliography).                       |
+:=====+:===========================================================+
| NOTE | > A TrueType font program may be embedded directly in a    |
| 2    | > PDF file as a stream object.                             |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > The Type 42 font format that is defined for PostScript   |
| 3    | > does not apply to PDF.                                   |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > For CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) fonts, the host  |
| 4    | > font system's font name is often encoded in the host     |
|      | > operating system's script. For instance, a Japanese font |
|      | > may have a name that is written in Japanese using some   |
|      | > (unidentified) Japanese encoding. Thus, TrueType font    |
|      | > names may contain multiple-byte character codes, each of |
|      | > which requires multiple characters to represent in a PDF |
|      | > name object (using the \# notation to quote special      |
|      | > characters as needed).                                   |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+

**9.6.4 Font Subsets**

PDF documents may include subsets of Type 1 and TrueType fonts. The font
and font descriptor that describe a font subset are slightly different
from those of ordinary fonts. These differences allow a conforming
reader to recognize font subsets and to merge documents containing
different subsets of the same font. (For more information on font
descriptors, see 9.8, \"Font Descriptors\".)

For a font subset, the PostScript name of the font---the value of the
font's **BaseFont** entry and the font descriptor's **FontName**
entry--- shall begin with a *tag* followed by a plus sign (+). The tag
shall consist of exactly six uppercase letters; the choice of letters is
arbitrary, but different subsets in the same PDF file shall have
different tags.

EXAMPLE EOODIA+Poetica is the name of a subset of Poetica^®^, a Type 1
font.

**9.6.5 Type 3 Fonts**

Type 3 fonts differ from the other fonts supported by PDF. A Type 3 font
dictionary defines the font; font dictionaries for other fonts simply
contain information *about* the font and refer to a separate font
program for the actual glyph descriptions. In Type 3 fonts, glyphs shall
be defined by streams of PDF graphics operators. These streams shall be
associated with glyph names. A separate encoding entry shall map
character codes to the appropriate glyph names for the glyphs.

NOTE 1 Type 3 fonts are more flexible than Type 1 fonts because the
glyph descriptions may contain arbitrary PDF graphics operators.
However, Type 3 fonts have no hinting mechanism for improving output at
small sizes or low resolutions.

A Type 3 font dictionary may contain the entries listed in Table 112.

|                    |            | the *font bounding box*. This is the  |
|                    |            | smallest rectangle enclosing the      |
|                    |            | shape that would result if all of the |

|                    |            | based on the font bounding box. If    |

+--------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **ToUnicode**      | stream     | *(Optional; PDF 1.2)* A stream        |
|                    |            | containing a CMap file that maps      |
|                    |            | character codes to Unicode values     |
|                    |            | (see 9.10, \"Extraction of Text       |
|                    |            | Content\").                           |
+--------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+

For each character code shown by a text-showing operator that uses a
Type 3 font, the conforming reader shall:

a)  Look up the character code in the font's **Encoding** entry, as
    described in 9.6.6, \"Character Encoding,\" to obtain a glyph name.

b)  Look up the glyph name in the font's **CharProcs** dictionary to
    obtain a stream object containing a glyph description. If the name
    is not present as a key in **CharProcs**, no glyph shall be painted.

c)  Invoke the glyph description. The graphics state shall be saved
    before this invocation and shall be restored afterward; therefore,
    any changes the glyph description makes to the graphics state do not
    persist after it finishes.

When the glyph description begins execution, the current transformation
matrix (CTM) shall be the concatenation of the font matrix
(**FontMatrix** in the current font dictionary) and the text space that
was in effect at the time the text-showing operator was invoked (see
9.4.4, \"Text Space Details\"). This means that shapes described in the
glyph coordinate system are transformed into the user coordinate system
and appear in the appropriate size and orientation on the page. The
glyph description shall describe the glyph in terms of absolute
coordinates in the glyph coordinate system, placing the glyph origin at
(0, 0) in this space. It shall make no assumptions about the initial
text position.

Aside from the CTM, the graphics state shall be inherited from the
environment of the text-showing operator that caused the glyph
description to be invoked. To ensure predictable results, the glyph
description shall initialize any graphics state parameters on which it
depends. In particular, if it invokes the **S** (stroke) operator, it
shall explicitly set the line width, line join, line cap, and dash
pattern to appropriate values.

NOTE 2 Normally, it is unnecessary and undesirable to initialize the
current colour parameter because the text-showing operators are designed
to paint glyphs with the current colour.

The glyph description shall execute one of the operators described in
Table 113 to pass width and bounding box information to the font
machinery. This shall precede the execution of any path construction or
pathpainting operators describing the glyph.

NOTE 3 Type 3 fonts in PDF are very similar to those in PostScript. Some
of the information provided in Type 3 font dictionaries and glyph
descriptions, while seemingly redundant or unnecessary, is nevertheless
required for correct results when a conforming reader prints to a
PostScript output device. This applies particularly to the operands of
the ***d0*** and ***d1*** operators, are the equivalent of PostScript\'s
***setcharwidth*** and ***setcachedevice***. For further explanation,
see Section 5.7 of the PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition.

**9.6.6 Character Encoding**

**9.6.6.1 General**

A font's *encoding* is the association between character codes (obtained
from text strings that are shown) and glyph descriptions. This
sub-clause describes the character encoding scheme used with simple PDF
fonts. Composite fonts (Type 0) use a different character mapping
algorithm, as discussed in 9.7, \"Composite Fonts\".

Except for Type 3 fonts, every font program shall have a built-in
encoding. Under certain circumstances, a PDF font dictionary may change
the encoding used with the font program to match the requirements of the
conforming writer generating the text being shown.

NOTE This flexibility in character encoding is valuable for two reasons:

> It permits showing text that is encoded according to any of the
> various existing conventions. For example, the Microsoft Windows and
> Apple Mac OS operating systems use different standard encodings for
> Latin text, and many conforming writers use their own special-purpose
> encodings.

It permits conforming writers to specify how characters selected from a
large character set are to be encoded.

Some character sets consist of more than 256 characters, including
ligatures, accented characters, and other symbols required for
high-quality typography or non-Latin writing systems. Different
encodings may select different subsets of the same character set.

One commonly used font encoding for Latin-text font programs is often
referred to as **StandardEncoding** or sometimes as the Adobe standard
encoding. The name **StandardEncoding** shall have no special meaning in
PDF, but this encoding does play a role as a default encoding (as shown
in Table 114). The regular encodings used for Latin-text fonts on Mac OS
and Windows systems shall be named **MacRomanEncoding** and
**WinAnsiEncoding**, respectively. An encoding named
**MacExpertEncoding** may be used with "expert" fonts that contain
additional characters useful for sophisticated typography. Complete
details of these encodings and of the characters present in typical
fonts are provided in Annex D.

In PDF, a font is classified as either *nonsymbolic* or *symbolic*
according to whether all of its characters are members of the standard
Latin character set; see D.2, "Latin Character Set and Encodings". This
shall be indicated by flags in the font descriptor; see 9.8.2, \"Font
Descriptor Flags\". Symbolic fonts contain other character sets, to
which the encodings mentioned previously ordinarily do not apply. Such
font programs have built-in encodings that are usually unique to each
font. The standard 14 fonts include two symbolic fonts, Symbol and
ZapfDingbats, whose encodings and character sets are documented in Annex
D.

A font program's built-in encoding may be overridden by including an
**Encoding** entry in the PDF font dictionary. The possible encoding
modifications depend on the font type. The value of the **Encoding**
entry shall be either a named encoding (the name of one of the
predefined encodings **MacRomanEncoding**, **MacExpertEncoding**, or
**WinAnsiEncoding**) or an *encoding dictionary*. An encoding dictionary
contains the entries listed in Table 114.

**9.6.6.2 Encodings for Type 1 Fonts**

A Type 1 font program's glyph descriptions are keyed by glyph *names*,
not by character *codes*. Glyph names are ordinary PDF name objects.
Descriptions of Latin alphabetic characters are normally associated with
names consisting of single letters, such as **A** or **a**. Other
characters are associated with names composed of words, such as three,
ampersand, or parenleft. A Type 1 font's built-in encoding shall be
defined by an **Encoding** array that is part of the font program, not
to be confused with the **Encoding** entry in the PDF font dictionary.

An **Encoding** entry may override a Type 1 font's mapping from
character codes to character names. The **Differences** array may map a
code to the name of any glyph description that exists in the font
program, regardless of whether that glyph is referenced by the font's
built-in encoding or by the encoding specified in the **BaseEncoding**
entry.

All Type 1 font programs shall contain an actual glyph named . notdef.
The effect produced by showing the . notdef glyph is at the discretion
of the font designer. If an encoding maps to a character name that does
not exist in the Type 1 font program, the . notdef glyph shall be
substituted.

**9.6.6.3 Encodings for Type 3 Fonts**

A Type 3 font, like a Type 1 font, contains glyph descriptions that are
keyed by glyph names; in this case, they appear as explicit keys in the
font's **CharProcs** dictionary. A Type 3 font's mapping from character
codes to glyph names shall be entirely defined by its **Encoding**
entry, which is required in this case.

**9.6.6.4 Encodings for TrueType Fonts**

A TrueType font program's built-in encoding maps directly from character
codes to glyph descriptions by means of an internal data structure
called a "cmap" (not to be confused with the CMap described in 9.7.5,
\"CMaps\"). This sub-clause describes how the PDF font dictionary's
**Encoding** entry shall be used in conjunction with a "cmap" to map
from a character code in a string to a glyph description in a TrueType
font program.

A "cmap" table may contain one or more subtables that represent multiple
encodings intended for use on different platforms (such as Mac OS and
Windows). Each subtable shall be identified by the two numbers, such as
(3, 1), that represent a combination of a *platform ID* and a
*platform-specific encoding ID*, respectively.

Glyph names are not required in TrueType fonts, although some font
programs have an optional "post" table listing glyph names for the
glyphs. If the conforming reader needs to select glyph descriptions by
name, it translates from glyph names to codes in one of the encodings
given in the font program's "cmap" table. When there is no character
code in the "cmap" that corresponds to a glyph name, the "post" table
shall be used to select a glyph description directly from the glyph
name.

Because some aspects of TrueType glyph selection are dependent on the
conforming reader or the operating system, PDF files that use TrueType
fonts should follow certain guidelines to ensure predictable behaviour
across all conforming readers:

- The font program should be embedded.

- A nonsymbolic font should specify **MacRomanEncoding** or
  **WinAnsiEncoding** as the value of its **Encoding** entry, with no
  **Differences** array.

- A font that is used to display glyphs that do not use
  **MacRomanEncoding** or **WinAnsiEncoding** should not specify an
  **Encoding** entry. The font descriptor's Symbolic flag (see
  Table 123) should be set, and its font program's "cmap" table should
  contain a (1, 0) subtable. It may also contain a (3, 0) subtable; if
  present, this subtable should map from character codes in the range
  0xF000 to 0xF0FF by prepending the single-byte codes in the (1, 0)
  subtable with 0xF0 and mapping to the corresponding glyph
  descriptions.

NOTE 1 Some popular TrueType font programs contain incorrect encoding
information. Implementations of TrueType font interpreters have evolved
heuristics for dealing with such problems; those heuristics are not
described here. For maximum portability, only well-formed TrueType font
programs should be used in PDF files. Therefore, a TrueType font program
in a PDF file may need to be modified to conform to these guidelines.

The following paragraphs describe the treatment of TrueType font
encodings beginning with PDF 1.3.

If the font has a named **Encoding** entry of either
**MacRomanEncoding** or **WinAnsiEncoding**, or if the font descriptor's
Nonsymbolic flag (see Table 123) is set, the conforming reader shall
create a table that maps from character codes to glyph names:

- If the **Encoding** entry is one of the names **MacRomanEncoding** or
  **WinAnsiEncoding**, the table shall be initialized with the mappings
  described in Annex D.

- If the **Encoding** entry is a dictionary, the table shall be
  initialized with the entries from the dictionary's **BaseEncoding**
  entry (see Table 114). Any entries in the **Differences** array shall
  be used to update the table. Finally, any undefined entries in the
  table shall be filled using **StandardEncoding**.

If a (3, 1) "cmap" subtable (Microsoft Unicode) is present:

- A character code shall be first mapped to a glyph name using the table
  described above.

- The glyph name shall then be mapped to a Unicode value by consulting
  the *Adobe Glyph List* (see the Bibliography).

- Finally, the Unicode value shall be mapped to a glyph description
  according to the (3, 1) subtable.

If no (3, 1) subtable is present but a (1, 0) subtable (Macintosh Roman)
is present:

- A character code shall be first mapped to a glyph name using the table
  described above.

- The glyph name shall then be mapped back to a character code according
  to the standard Roman encoding used on Mac OS.

- Finally, the code shall be mapped to a glyph description according to
  the (1, 0) subtable.

In any of these cases, if the glyph name cannot be mapped as specified,
the glyph name shall be looked up in the font program's "post" table (if
one is present) and the associated glyph description shall be used.

The standard Roman encoding that is used on Mac OS is the same as the
***MacRomanEncoding*** described in Annex D, with the addition of 15
entries and the replacement of the currency glyph with the Euro glyph,
as shown in Table 115.

When the font has no **Encoding** entry, or the font descriptor's
Symbolic flag is set (in which case the **Encoding** entry is ignored),
this shall occur:

- If the font contains a (3, 0) subtable, the range of character codes
  shall be one of these: 0x0000 - 0x00FF, 0xF000 - 0xF0FF, 0xF100 -
  0xF1FF, or 0xF200 - 0xF2FF. Depending on the range of codes, each byte
  from the string shall be prepended with the high byte of the range, to
  form a two-byte character, which shall be used to select the
  associated glyph description from the subtable.

- Otherwise, if the font contains a (1, 0) subtable, single bytes from
  the string shall be used to look up the associated glyph descriptions
  from the subtable.

If a character cannot be mapped in any of the ways described previously,
a conforming reader may supply a mapping of its choosing.

##  9.7 Composite Fonts

**9.7.1 General**

A *composite font,* also called a Type 0 font, is one whose glyphs are
obtained from a fontlike object called a *CIDFont*. A composite font
shall be represented by a font dictionary whose **Subtype** value is
**Type0**. The Type 0 font is known as the *root font*, and its
associated CIDFont is called its *descendant.*

NOTE 1 Composite fonts in PDF are analogous to composite fonts in
PostScript but with some limitations. In particular, PDF requires that
the character encoding be defined by a CMap, which is only one of
several encoding methods available in PostScript. Also, PostScript
allows a Type 0 font to have multiple descendants, which might also be
Type 0 fonts. PDF supports only a single descendant, which shall be a
CIDFont.

When the current font is composite, the text-showing operators shall
behave differently than with simple fonts. For simple fonts, each byte
of a string to be shown selects one glyph, whereas for composite fonts,
a sequence of one or more bytes are decoded to select a glyph from the
descendant CIDFont.

NOTE 2 This facility supports the use of very large character sets, such
as those for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. It also
simplifies the organization of fonts that have complex encoding
requirements.

This sub-clause first introduces the architecture of *CID-keyed*
*fonts*, which are the only kind of composite font supported in PDF.
Then it describes the *CIDFont* and *CMap* dictionaries, which are the
PDF objects that represent the correspondingly named components of a
CID-keyed font. Finally, it describes the Type 0 font dictionary, which
combines a CIDFont and a CMap to produce a font whose glyphs may be
accessed by means of variable-length character codes in a string to be
shown.

**9.7.2 CID-Keyed Fonts Overview**

CID-keyed fonts provide a convenient and efficient method for defining
multiple-byte character encodings and fonts with a large number of
glyphs. These capabilities provide great flexibility for representing
text in writing systems for languages with large character sets, such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK).

The *CID-keyed font* architecture specifies the external representation
of certain font programs, called *CMap* and *CIDFont* files, along with
some conventions for combining and using those files. As mentioned
earlier, PDF does not support the entire CID-keyed font architecture,
which is independent of PDF; CID-keyed fonts may be used in other
environments.

NOTE For complete documentation on the architecture and the file
formats, see Adobe Technical Notes #5092, *CIDKeyed Font Technology
Overview*, and #5014, *Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification*. This
sub-clause describes only the PDF objects that represent these font
programs.

The term *CID-keyed font* reflects the fact that *CID* (character
identifier) numbers are used to index and access the glyph descriptions
in the font. This method is more efficient for large fonts than the
method of accessing by character name, as is used for some simple fonts.
CIDs range from 0 to a maximum value that may be subject to an
implementation limit (see Table C.1).

A *character collection* is an ordered set of glyphs. The order of the
glyphs in the character collection shall determine the CID number for
each glyph. Each CID-keyed font shall explicitly reference the character
collection on which its CID numbers are based; see 9.7.3,
\"CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries\".

A *CMap* (character map) file shall specify the correspondence between
character codes and the CID numbers used to identify glyphs. It is
equivalent to the concept of an encoding in simple fonts. Whereas a
simple font allows a maximum of 256 glyphs to be encoded and accessible
at one time, a CMap can describe a mapping from multiple-byte codes to
thousands of glyphs in a large CID-keyed font.

EXAMPLE A CMap can describe Shift-JIS, one of several widely used
encodings for Japanese.

A CMap file may reference an entire character collection or a subset of
a character collection. The CMap file's mapping yields a *font number*
(which in PDF shall be 0) and a *character selector* (which in PDF shall
be a CID). Furthermore, a CMap file may incorporate another CMap file by
reference, without having to duplicate it. These features enable
character collections to be combined or supplemented and make all the
constituent characters accessible to text-showing operations through a
single encoding.

A *CIDFont* contains the glyph descriptions for a character collection.
The glyph descriptions themselves are typically in a format similar to
those used in simple fonts, such as Type 1. However, they are identified
by CIDs rather than by names, and they are organized differently.

In PDF, the data from a CMap file and CIDFont shall be represented by
PDF objects as described in 9.7.4, \"CIDFonts\" and 9.7.5, \"CMaps\".
The CMap file and CIDFont programs themselves may be either referenced
by name or embedded as stream objects in the PDF file.

A CID-keyed font, then, shall be the combination of a CMap with a
CIDFont containing glyph descriptions. It shall be represented as a Type
0 font. It contains an **Encoding** entry whose value shall be a CMap
dictionary, and its **DescendantFonts** entry shall reference the
CIDFont dictionary with which the CMap has been combined.

**9.7.3 CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries**

CIDFont and CMap dictionaries shall contain a **CIDSystemInfo** entry
specifying the character collection assumed by the CIDFont associated
with the CMap---that is, the interpretation of the CID numbers used by
the CIDFont. A character collection shall be uniquely identified by the
**Registry**, **Ordering**, and **Supplement** entries in the
**CIDSystemInfo** dictionary, as described in Table 116. In order to be
compatible, the Registry and Ordering values must be the same.

The **CIDSystemInfo** entry in a CIDFont is a dictionary that shall
specify the CIDFont's character collection. The CIDFont need not contain
glyph descriptions for all the CIDs in a collection; it may contain a
subset. The **CIDSystemInfo** entry in a CMap file shall be either a
single dictionary or an array of dictionaries, depending on whether it
associates codes with a single character collection or with multiple
character collections; see 9.7.5, \"CMaps\".

For proper behaviour, the **CIDSystemInfo** entry of a CMap shall be
compatible with that of the CIDFont or CIDFonts with which it is used.

                              assigned in a character collection, the
                              supplement number shall be increased.

                              collection. This value shall not be used

                              character collections.

**9.7.4 CIDFonts**

**9.7.4.1 General**

A CIDFont program contains glyph descriptions that are accessed using a
CID as the character selector. There are two types of CIDFonts:

- A Type 0 CIDFont contains glyph descriptions based on CFF

NOTE The term "Type 0" when applied to a CIDFont has a different meaning
than for a "Type 0 font".

- A Type 2 CIDFont contains glyph descriptions based on the TrueType
  font format

A CIDFont dictionary is a PDF object that contains information about a
CIDFont program. Although its **Type** value is **Font**, a CIDFont is
not actually a font. It does not have an **Encoding** entry, it may not
be listed in the **Font** subdictionary of a resource dictionary, and it
may not be used as the operand of the **Tf** operator. It shall be used
only as a descendant of a Type 0 font. The CMap in the Type 0 font shall
be what defines the encoding that maps character codes to CIDs in the
CIDFont. Table 117 lists the entries in a CIDFont dictionary.

                                    **CIDFontName** entry in the CIDFont
                                    program. For Type 2 CIDFonts, it shall
                                    be derived the same way as for a
                                    simple TrueType font; see 9.6.3,
                                    \"TrueType Fonts\". In either case,
                                    the name may have a subset prefix if
                                    appropriate; see 9.6.4, \"Font

|                 |          | file.                                |
+-----------------+----------+--------------------------------------+

**9.7.4.2 Glyph Selection in CIDFonts**

Type 0 and Type 2 CIDFonts handle the mapping from CIDs to glyph
descriptions in somewhat different ways.

For Type 0, the CIDFont program contains glyph descriptions that are
identified by CIDs. The CIDFont program identifies the character
collection by a **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary, which should be copied
into the PDF CIDFont dictionary. CIDs shall be interpreted uniformly in
all CIDFont programs supporting a given character collection, whether
the program is embedded in the PDF file or obtained from an external
source.

When the CIDFont contains an embedded font program that is represented
in the Compact Font Format (CFF), the **FontFile3** entry in the font
descriptor (see Table 126) may be **CIDFontType0C** or **OpenType**.
There are two cases, depending on the contents of the font program:

- The "CFF" font program has a Top DICT that uses CIDFont operators: The
  CIDs shall be used to determine the GID value for the glyph procedure
  using the charset table in the CFF program. The GID value shall then
  be used to look up the glyph procedure using the CharStrings INDEX
  table.

NOTE Although in many fonts the CID value and GID value are the same,
the CID and GID values may differ.

- The "CFF" font program has a Top DICT that does not use CIDFont
  operators: The CIDs shall be used directly as GID values, and the
  glyph procedure shall be retrieved using the CharStrings INDEX.

For Type 2, the CIDFont program is actually a TrueType font program,
which has no native notion of CIDs. In a TrueType font program, glyph
descriptions are identified by *glyph index* values. Glyph indices are
internal to the font and are not defined consistently from one font to
another. Instead, a TrueType font program contains a "cmap" table that
provides mappings directly from character codes to glyph indices for one
or more predefined encodings.

TrueType font programs are integrated with the CID-keyed font
architecture in one of two ways, depending on whether the font program
is embedded in the PDF file:

- If the TrueType font program is embedded, the Type 2 CIDFont
  dictionary shall contain a **CIDToGIDMap** entry that maps CIDs to the
  glyph indices for the appropriate glyph descriptions in that font
  program.

- If the TrueType font program is not embedded but is referenced by
  name, the Type 2 CIDFont dictionary shall *not* contain a
  **CIDToGIDMap** entry, since it is not meaningful to refer to glyph
  indices in an external font program. In this case, CIDs shall not
  participate in glyph selection, and only predefined CMaps may be used
  with this CIDFont (see 9.7.5, \"CMaps\"). The conforming reader shall
  select glyphs by translating characters from the encoding specified by
  the predefined CMap to one of the encodings in the TrueType font's
  "cmap" table. The means by which this is accomplished are
  implementation-dependent.

Even though the CIDs are not used to select glyphs in a Type 2 CIDFont,
they shall always be used to determine the glyph metrics, as described
in the next sub-clause.

Every CIDFont shall contain a glyph description for CID 0, which is
analogous to the . notdef character name in simple fonts (see 9.7.6.3,
\"Handling Undefined Characters\").

**9.7.4.3 Glyph Metrics in CIDFonts**

As discussed in 9.2.4, \"Glyph Positioning and Metrics\", the *width* of
a glyph refers to the horizontal displacement between the origin of the
glyph and the origin of the next glyph when writing in horizontal mode.
In this mode, the vertical displacement between origins shall be 0.
Widths for a CIDFont are defined using the **DW** and **W** entries in
the CIDFont dictionary. These widths shall be consistent with the actual
widths given in the CIDFont program.

The **W** array allows the definition of widths for individual CIDs. The
elements of the array shall be organized in groups of two or three,
where each group shall be in one of these two formats:

> *c* \[ *w*~1~ *w*~2~ ... *w*~n~ \] *c*first *c*last *w*

In the first format, *c* shall be an integer specifying a starting CID
value; it shall be followed by an array of *n* numbers that shall
specify the widths for *n* consecutive CIDs, starting with *c*. The
second format shall define the same width, *w*, for all CIDs in the
range *c*first to *c*last .

EXAMPLE 1 In this example, the glyphs having CIDs 120, 121, and 122 are
400, 325, and 500 units wide, respectively. CIDs in the range 7080
through 8032 all have a width of 1000 units.

> **W** entry example:
>
> /W \[ 120 \[ 400 325 500 \]
>
> 7080 8032 1000
>
> \]

Glyphs from a CIDFont may be shown in vertical writing mode. This is
selected by the **WMode** entry in the associated CMap dictionary; see
9.7.5, \"CMaps\". To be used in this way, the CIDFont shall define the
vertical displacement for each glyph and the position vector that
relates the horizontal and vertical writing origins.

The default position vector and vertical displacement vector shall be
specified by the **DW2** entry in the CIDFont dictionary. **DW2** shall
be an array of two values: the vertical component of the position vector
*v* and the vertical component of the displacement vector *w1* (see
Figure 40). The horizontal component of the position vector shall be
half the glyph width, and that of the displacement vector shall be 0.

EXAMPLE 2 If the **DW2** entry is

> / DW2 \[ 880 −1000 \]
>
> then a glyph's position vector and vertical displacement vector are
>
> v = (*w0* ÷ 2, 880)
>
> *w1* = (0, --1000)
>
> where *w0* is the width (horizontal displacement) for the same glyph.

NOTE A negative value for the vertical component places the origin of
the next glyph *below* the current glyph because vertical coordinates in
a standard coordinate system increase from bottom to top.

The **W2** array shall define vertical metrics for individual CIDs. The
elements of the array shall be organized in groups of two or five, where
each group shall be in one of these two formats:

> *c* \[ *w1*~1y~ *v*~1x~ *v*~1y~ *w1*~2y~ *v*~2x~ *v*~2y~ ... \]
> *c*first *c*last *w1*1y *v*1x *v*1y

In the first format, *c* is a starting CID and shall be followed by an
array containing numbers interpreted in groups of three. Each group
shall consist of the vertical component of the vertical displacement
vector *w*1 (whose horizontal component shall be 0) followed by the
horizontal and vertical components for the position vector *v*.
Successive groups shall define the vertical metrics for consecutive CIDs
starting with *c*. The second format defines a range of CIDs from
*c*first to *c*last , that shall be followed by three numbers that
define the vertical metrics for all CIDs in this range.

EXAMPLE 3 This **W2** entry defines the vertical displacement vector for
the glyph with CID 120 as (0, −1000) and the position vector as (250,
772). It also defines the displacement vector for CIDs in the range 7080
through 8032 as (0, −1000) and the position vector as (500, 900).

> /W2 \[ 120 \[ −1000 250 772 \]
>
> 7080 8032 −1000 500 900
>
> \]

**9.7.5 CMaps**

**9.7.5.1 General**

A CMap shall specify the mapping from character codes to character
selectors. In PDF, the character selectors shall be CIDs in a CIDFont
(as mentioned earlier, PostScript CMaps can use names or codes as well).
A CMap serves a function analogous to the **Encoding** dictionary for a
simple font. The CMap shall not refer directly to a specific CIDFont;
instead, it shall be combined with it as part of a CID-keyed font,
represented in PDF as a Type 0 font dictionary (see 9.7.6, \"Type 0 Font
Dictionaries\"). Within the CMap, the character mappings shall refer to
the associated CIDFont by *font number*, which in PDF shall be 0.

PDF also uses a special type of CMap to map character codes to Unicode
values (see 9.10.3, \"ToUnicode CMaps\").

A CMap shall specify the writing mode---horizontal or vertical---for any
CIDFont with which the CMap is combined. The writing mode determines
which metrics shall be used when glyphs are painted from that font.

NOTE Writing mode is specified as part of the CMap because, in some
cases, different shapes are used when writing horizontally and
vertically. In such cases, the horizontal and vertical variants of a
CMap specify different CIDs for a given character code.

A CMap shall be specified in one of two ways:

- As a name object identifying a predefined CMap, whose value shall be
  one of the predefined CMap names defined in Table 118.

- As a stream object whose contents shall be a CMap file.

**9.7.5.2 Predefined CMaps**

Several of the CMaps define mappings from Unicode encodings to character
collections. Unicode values appearing in a text string shall be
represented in big-endian order (high-order byte first). CMap names
containing *"UCS2"* use UCS-2 encoding; names containing "*UTF16"* use
UTF-16BE (big-endian) encoding.

NOTE 1 Table 118 lists the names of the predefined CMaps. These CMaps
map character codes to CIDs in a single descendant CIDFont. CMaps whose
names end in H specify horizontal writing mode; those ending in V
specify vertical writing mode.

NOTE 2 The Identity-H and Identity-V CMaps may be used to refer to
glyphs directly by their CIDs when showing a text string.

When the current font is a Type 0 font whose Encoding entry is
Identity-H or Identity-V, the string to be shown shall contain pairs of
bytes representing CIDs, high-order byte first. When the current font is
a CIDFont, the string to be shown shall contain pairs of bytes
representing CIDs, high-order byte first. When the current font is a
Type 2 CIDFont in which the CIDToGIDMap entry is Identity and if the
TrueType font is embedded in the PDF file, the 2-byte CID values shall
be identical glyph indices for the glyph descriptions in the TrueType
font program.

A conforming reader shall support all of the character collections
listed in Table 119. As noted in 9.7.3, \"CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries\",
a character collection is identified by registry, ordering, and
supplement number, and supplements are cumulative; that is, a
higher-numbered supplement includes the CIDs contained in lowernumbered
supplements, as well as some additional CIDs. Consequently, text encoded
according to the predefined CMaps for a given PDF version shall be valid
when interpreted by a conforming reader supporting the same or a later
PDF version. When interpreted by a conforming reader supporting an
earlier PDF version, such text causes an error if a CMap is encountered
that is not predefined for that PDF version. If character codes are
encountered that were added in a higher-numbered supplement than the one
corresponding to the supported PDF version, no characters are displayed
for those codes; see 9.7.6.3, \"Handling Undefined Characters\".

The Identity-H and Identity-V CMaps shall not be used with a
non-embedded font. Only standardized character sets may be used.

NOTE 4 If a conforming writer producing a PDF file encounters text to be
included that uses CIDs from a highernumbered supplement than the one
corresponding to the PDF version being generated, the application should
embed the CMap for the higher-numbered supplement rather than refer to
the predefined CMap.

The CMap programs that define the predefined CMaps are available through
the ASN Web site.

**9.7.5.3 Embedded CMap Files**

For character encodings that are not predefined, the PDF file shall
contain a stream that defines the CMap. In addition to the standard

**9.7.5.4 CMap Example and Operator Summary**

Embedded CMap files shall conform to the format documented in Adobe
Technical Note #5014, subject to these additional constraints:

a)  If the embedded CMap file contains a usecmap reference, the CMap
    indicated there shall also be identified by the UseCMap entry in the
    CMap stream dictionary.

b)  The usefont operator, if present, shall specify a font number of 0.

c)  The beginbfchar and endbfchar shall not appear in a CMap that is
    used as the Encoding entry of a Type 0 font; however, they may
    appear in the definition of a ToUnicode CMap.

d)  A notdef mapping, defined using beginnotdefchar, endnotdefchar,
    beginnotdefrange, and endnotdefrange shall be used if the normal
    mapping produces a CID for which no glyph is present in the
    associated CIDFont.

e)  The beginrearrangedfont, endrearrangedfont, beginusematrix, and
    endusematrix operators shall not be used.

EXAMPLE This example shows a sample CMap for a Japanese Shift-JIS
encoding. Character codes in this encoding can be either 1 or 2 bytes in
length. This CMap could be used with a CIDFont that uses the same CID
ordering as specified in the **CIDSystemInfo** entry. Note that several
of the entries in the stream dictionary are also replicated in the
stream data.

**9.7.6.2 CMap Mapping**

The **Encoding** entry of a Type 0 font dictionary specifies a CMap that
specifies how text-showing operators (such as **Tj**) shall interpret
the bytes in the string to be shown when the current font is the Type 0
font. This subclause describes how the characters in the string shall be
decoded and mapped into character selectors, which in PDF are always
CIDs.

The codespace ranges in the CMap (delimited by **begincodespacerange**
and **endcodespacerange**) specify how many bytes are extracted from the
string for each successive character code. A codespace range shall be
specified by a pair of codes of some particular length giving the lower
and upper bounds of that range. A code shall be considered to match the
range if it is the same length as the bounding codes and the value of
each of its bytes lies between the corresponding bytes of the lower and
upper bounds. The code length shall not be greater than 4.

A sequence of one or more bytes shall be extracted from the string and
matched against the codespace ranges in the CMap. That is, the first
byte shall be matched against 1-byte codespace ranges; if no match is
found, a second byte shall be extracted, and the 2-byte code shall be
matched against 2-byte codespace ranges. This process continues for
successively longer codes until a match is found or all codespace ranges
have been tested. There will be at most one match because codespace
ranges shall not overlap.

The code extracted from the string shall be looked up in the character
code mappings for codes of that length. (These are the mappings defined
by **beginbfchar**, **endbfchar**, **begincidchar**, **endcidchar**, and
corresponding operators for ranges.) Failing that, it shall be looked up
in the notdef mappings, as described in the next subclause.

The results of the CMap mapping algorithm are a font number and a
character selector. The font number shall be used as an index into the
Type 0 font's **DescendantFonts** array to select a CIDFont. In PDF, the
font number shall be 0 and the character selector shall be a CID; this
is the only case described here. The CID shall then be used to select a
glyph in the CIDFont. If the CIDFont contains no glyph for that CID, the
*notdef mappings* shall be consulted, as described in 9.7.6.3,
\"Handling Undefined Characters\".

**9.7.6.3 Handling Undefined Characters**

A CMap mapping operation can fail to select a glyph for a variety of
reasons. This sub-clause describes those reasons and what happens when
they occur.

If a code maps to a CID for which no such glyph exists in the descendant
CIDFont, the *notdef mappings* in the CMap shall be consulted to obtain
a substitute character selector. These mappings are delimited by the
operators **beginnotdefchar**, **endnotdefchar**, **beginnotdefrange**,
and **endnotdefrange** within an embedded CMap file. They shall always
map to a CID. If a matching notdef mapping is found, the CID selects a
glyph in the associated descendant, which shall be a CIDFont. If no
glyph exists for that CID, the glyph for CID 0 (which shall be present)
shall be substituted.

NOTE 5 The *notdef mappings are similar to* the . notdef character
mechanism in simple fonts.

If the CMap does not contain either a character mapping or a notdef
mapping for the code, descendant 0 shall be selected and the glyph for
CID 0 shall be substituted from the associated CIDFont.

If the code is invalid---that is, the bytes extracted from the string to
be shown do not match any codespace range in the CMap---a substitute
glyph is chosen as just described. The character mapping algorithm shall
be reset to its original position in the string, and a modified mapping
algorithm chooses the best partially matching codespace range:

a)  If the first byte extracted from the string to be shown does not
    match the first byte of any codespace range, the range having the
    shortest codes shall be chosen.

b)  Otherwise (that is, if there is a partial match), for each
    additional byte extracted, the code accumulated so far shall be
    matched against the beginnings of all longer codespace ranges until
    the longest such partial match has been found. If multiple codespace
    ranges have partial matches of the same length, the one having the
    shortest codes shall be chosen.

The length of the codes in the chosen codespace range determines the
total number of bytes to consume from the string for the current mapping
operation.

##  9.8 Font Descriptors

**9.8.1 General**

A *font descriptor* specifies metrics and other attributes of a simple
font or a CIDFont as a whole, as distinct from the metrics of individual
glyphs. These font metrics provide information that enables a conforming
reader to synthesize a substitute font or select a similar font when the
font program is unavailable. The font descriptor may also be used to
embed the font program in the PDF file.

Font descriptors shall not be used with Type 0 fonts. Beginning with PDF
1.5, font descriptors may be used with Type 3 fonts.

A font descriptor is a dictionary whose entries specify various font
attributes. The entries common to all font descriptors---for both simple
fonts and CIDFonts---are listed in Table 122. Additional entries in the
font descriptor for a CIDFont are described in 9.8.3, \"Font Descriptors
for CIDFonts\". All integer values shall be units in glyph space. The
conversion from glyph space to text space is described in 9.2.4, \"Glyph
Positioning and Metrics\".

The Nonsymbolic flag (bit 6 in the **Flags** entry) indicates that the
font's character set is the Adobe standard Latin character set (or a
subset of it) and that it uses the standard names for those glyphs. This
character set is shown in D.2, \"Latin Character Set and Encodings\". If
the font contains any glyphs outside this set, the Symbolic flag shall
be set and the Nonsymbolic flag shall be clear. In other words, any font
whose character set is not a subset of the Adobe standard character set
shall be considered to be symbolic. This influences the font's implicit
base encoding and may affect a conforming reader's font substitution
strategies.

NOTE 1 This classification of nonsymbolic and symbolic fonts is peculiar
to PDF. A font may contain additional characters that are used in Latin
writing systems but are outside the Adobe standard Latin character set;
PDF considers such a font to be symbolic. The use of two flags to
represent a single binary choice is a historical accident.

The ForceBold flag (bit 19) shall determine whether bold glyphs shall be
painted with extra pixels even at very small text sizes by a conforming
reader. If the ForceBold flag is set, features of bold glyphs may be
thickened at small text sizes.

NOTE 2 Typically, when glyphs are painted at small sizes on very
low-resolution devices such as display screens, features of bold glyphs
may appear only 1 pixel wide. Because this is the minimum feature width
on a pixelbased device, ordinary (nonbold) glyphs also appear with
1-pixel-wide features and therefore cannot be distinguished from bold
glyphs.

+------------+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| **Key**    | **Type**   | **Value**                                 |
+:===========+:===========+===========================================+
| **Style**  | dictionary | *(Optional)* A dictionary containing      |
|            |            | entries that describe the style of the    |
|            |            | glyphs in the font (see 9.8.3.2,          |
|            |            | \"Style\").                               |
+------------+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| **Lang**   | name       | *(Optional; PDF 1.5)* A name specifying   |
|            |            | the language of the font, which may be    |
|            |            | used for encodings where the language is  |
|            |            | not implied by the encoding itself. The   |
|            |            | value shall be one of the codes defined   |
|            |            | by Internet RFC 3066, *Tags for the       |
|            |            | Identification of Languages* or (*PDF     |
|            |            | 1.0*) 2-character language codes defined  |
|            |            | by ISO 639 (see the Bibliography). If     |
|            |            | this entry is absent, the language shall  |
|            |            | be considered to be unknown.              |
+------------+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| **FD**     | dictionary | *(Optional)* A dictionary whose keys      |
|            |            | identify a class of glyphs in a CIDFont.  |
|            |            | Each value shall be a dictionary          |
|            |            | containing entries that shall override    |
|            |            | the corresponding values in the main font |
|            |            | descriptor dictionary for that class of   |
|            |            | glyphs (see 9.8.3.3, \"FD\").             |
+------------+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| **CIDSet** | stream     | *(Optional)* A stream identifying which   |
|            |            | CIDs are present in the CIDFont file. If  |
|            |            | this entry is present, the CIDFont shall  |
|            |            | contain only a subset of the glyphs in    |
|            |            | the character collection defined by the   |
|            |            | **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary. If it is    |
|            |            | absent, the only indication of a CIDFont  |
|            |            | subset shall be the subset tag in the     |
|            |            | **FontName** entry (see 9.6.4, \"Font     |
|            |            | Subsets\").                               |
|            |            |                                           |
|            |            | The stream's data shall be organized as a |
|            |            | table of bits indexed by CID. The bits    |
|            |            | shall be stored in bytes with the         |
|            |            | high-order bit first. Each bit shall      |
|            |            | correspond to a CID. The most significant |
|            |            | bit of the first byte shall correspond to |
|            |            | CID 0, the next bit to CID 1, and so on.  |
+------------+------------+-------------------------------------------+

**9.8.3.2 Style**

The **Style** dictionary contains entries that define style attributes
and values for the CIDFont. Only the **Panose** entry is defined. The
value of **Panose** shall be a 12-byte string consisting of these
elements:

- The font family class and subclass ID bytes, given in the sFamilyClass
  field of the "OS/2" table in a TrueType font. This field is documented
  in Microsoft's *TrueType 1.0 Font Files Technical Specification*.

- Ten bytes for the PANOSE classification number for the font. The
  PANOSE classification system is documented in Hewlett-Packard
  Company's *PANOSE Classification Metrics Guide*.

See the Bibliography for more information about these documents.

EXAMPLE This is an example of a **Style** entry in the font descriptor:

> /Style \<\< /Panose \< 01 05 02 02 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \> \>\>

**9.8.3.3 FD**

A CIDFont may be made up of different classes of glyphs, each class
requiring different sets of the font-wide attributes that appear in font
descriptors.

EXAMPLE 1 Latin glyphs, for example, may require different attributes
than kanji glyphs.

The font descriptor shall define a set of default attributes that apply
to all glyphs in the CIDFont. The **FD** entry in the font descriptor
shall contain exceptions to these defaults.

The key for each entry in an **FD** dictionary shall be the name of a
class of glyphs---that is, a particular subset of the CIDFont's
character collection. The entry's value shall be a font descriptor whose
contents shall override the font-wide attributes for that class only.
This font descriptor shall contain entries for metric information only;
it shall not include **FontFile**, **FontFile2**, **FontFile3**, or any
of the entries listed in Table 122.

The **FD** dictionary should contain at least the metrics for the
proportional Latin glyphs. With the information for these glyphs, a more
accurate substitution font can be created.

The names of the glyph classes depend on the character collection, as
identified by the **Registry**, **Ordering**, and **Supplement** entries
in the **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary. Table 125 lists the valid keys for
the Adobe-GB1, Adobe-CNS1, Adobe-Japan1, Adobe-Japan2, and Adobe-Korea1
character collections.

## 9.9 Embedded Font Programs

A font program may be embedded in a PDF file as data contained in a PDF
stream object.

NOTE 1 Such a stream object is also called a *font file* by analogy with
font programs that are available from sources external to the conforming
writer.

Font programs are subject to copyright, and the copyright owner may
impose conditions under which a font program may be used. These
permissions are recorded either in the font program or as part of a
separate license. One of the conditions may be that the font program
cannot be embedded, in which case it should not be incorporated into a
PDF file. A font program may allow embedding for the sole purpose of
viewing and printing the document but not for creating new or modified
text that uses the font (in either the same document or other
documents). The latter operation would require the user performing the
operation to have a licensed copy of the font program, not a copy
extracted from the PDF file. In the absence of explicit information to
the contrary, embedded font programs shall be used only to view and
print the document and not for any other purposes.

Table 126 summarizes the ways in which font programs shall be embedded
in a PDF file, depending on the representation of the font program. The
key shall be the name used in the font descriptor to refer to the font
file stream; the subtype shall be the value of the **Subtype** key, if
present, in the font file stream dictionary. Further details of specific
font program representations are given below.

NOTE 2 A standard Type 1 font program, as described in the *Adobe Type 1
Font Format* specification, consists of three parts: a clear-text
portion (written using PostScript syntax), an encrypted portion, and a
fixed-content portion. The fixed-content portion contains 512 ASCII
zeros followed by a **cleartomark** operator, and perhaps followed

> by additional data. Although the encrypted portion of a standard Type
> 1 font may be in binary or ASCII hexadecimal format, PDF supports only

As noted in Table 126, a Type 1--equivalent font program or a Type 0
CIDFont program may be represented in the Compact Font Format (CFF). The
**Length1**, **Length2**, and **Length3** entries are not needed in that
case and shall not be present. Although CFF enables multiple font or
CIDFont programs to be bundled together in a single file, an embedded
CFF font file in PDF shall consist of exactly one font or CIDFont (as
appropriate for the associated font dictionary).

According to the Adobe Type 1 Font Format specification, a Type 1 font
program may contain a ***PaintType*** entry specifying whether the
glyphs' outlines are to be filled or stroked. For fonts embedded in a
PDF file, this entry shall be ignored; the decision whether to fill or
stroke glyph outlines is entirely determined by the PDF text rendering
mode parameter (see 9.3.6, \"Text Rendering Mode\"). This shall also
applies to Type 1 compact fonts and Type 0 compact CIDFonts.

A TrueType font program may be used as part of either a font or a
CIDFont. Although the basic font file format is the same in both cases,
there are different requirements for what information shall be present
in the font program. These TrueType tables shall always be present if
present in the original TrueType font program: "head", "hhea", "loca",
"maxp", "cvt", "prep", "glyf", "hmtx", and "fpgm". If used with a simple
font dictionary, the font program shall additionally contain a cmap
table defining one or more encodings, as discussed in 9.6.6.4,
\"Encodings for TrueType Fonts\". If used with a CIDFont dictionary, the
cmap table is not needed and shall not be present, since the mapping
from character codes to glyph descriptions is provided separately.

The "vhea" and "vmtx" tables that specify vertical metrics shall never
be used by a conforming reader. The only way to specify vertical metrics
in PDF shall be by means of the ***DW2*** and ***W2*** entries in a
CIDFont dictionary.

NOTE 3 Beginning with PDF 1.6, font programs may be embedded using the
OpenType format, which is an extension of the TrueType format that
allows inclusion of font programs using the Compact Font Format (CFF).
It also allows inclusion of data to describe glyph substitutions,
kerning, and baseline adjustments. In addition to rendering glyphs,
conforming readers may use the data in OpenType fonts to do advanced
line layout, automatically substitute ligatures, provide selections of
alternate glyphs to users, and handle complex writing scripts.

The process of finding glyph descriptions in OpenType fonts by a
conforming reader shall be the following:

- For Type 1 fonts using "CFF" tables, the process shall be as described
  in 9.6.6.2, \"Encodings for Type 1 Fonts\".

- For TrueType fonts using "glyf" tables, the process shall be as
  described in 9.6.6.4, \"Encodings for TrueType Fonts\". Since this
  process sometimes produces ambiguous results, conforming writers,
  instead of using a simple font, shall use a Type 0 font with an
  Identity-H encoding and use the glyph indices as character codes, as
  described following Table 118.

- For **CIDFontType0** fonts using "CFF" tables, the process shall be as
  described in the discussion of embedded Type 0 CIDFonts in 9.7.4.2,
  \"Glyph Selection in CIDFonts\".

- For **CIDFontType2** fonts using "glyf" tables, the process shall be
  as described in the discussion of embedded Type 2 CIDFonts in 9.7.4.2,
  \"Glyph Selection in CIDFonts\".

As discussed in 9.6.4, \"Font Subsets\", an embedded font program may
contain only the subset of glyphs that are used in the PDF document.
This may be indicated by the presence of a **CharSet** or **CIDSet**
entry in the font descriptor that refers to the font file.

## 9.10 Extraction of Text Content

**9.10.1 General**

The preceding sub-clauses describe all the facilities for showing text
and causing glyphs to be painted on the page. In addition to displaying
text, conforming readers sometimes need to determine the information
content of text---that is, its meaning according to some standard
character identification as opposed to its rendered appearance. This
need arises during operations such as searching, indexing, and exporting
of text to other file formats.

The Unicode standard defines a system for numbering all of the common
characters used in a large number of languages. It is a suitable scheme
for representing the information content of text, but not its
appearance, since Unicode values identify characters, not glyphs. For
information about Unicode, see the *Unicode Standard* by the Unicode
Consortium (see the Bibliography).

When extracting character content, a conforming reader can easily
convert text to Unicode values if a font's characters are identified
according to a standard character set that is known to the conforming
reader. This character identification can occur if either the font uses
a standard named encoding or the characters in the font are identified
by standard character names or CIDs in a well-known collection. 9.10.2,
\"Mapping Character Codes to Unicode Values\", describes in detail the
overall algorithm for mapping character codes to Unicode values.

If a font is not defined in one of these ways, the glyphs can still be
shown, but the characters cannot be converted to Unicode values without
additional information:

- This information can be provided as an optional **ToUnicode** entry in
  the font dictionary *(PDF 1.2*; see 9.10.3, \"ToUnicode CMaps\"*)*,
  whose value shall be a stream object containing a special kind of CMap
  file that maps character codes to Unicode values.

- An **ActualText** entry for a structure element or marked-content
  sequence (see 14.9.4, \"Replacement Text\") may be used to specify the
  text content directly.

**9.10.2 Mapping Character Codes to Unicode Values**

A conforming reader can use these methods, in the priority given, to map
a character code to a Unicode value. Tagged PDF documents, in
particular, shall provide at least one of these methods (see 14.8.2.4.2,
\"Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF\"):

- If the font dictionary contains a **ToUnicode** CMap (see 9.10.3,
  \"ToUnicode CMaps\"), use that CMap to convert the character code to
  Unicode.

- If the font is a simple font that uses one of the predefined encodings
  **MacRomanEncoding**, **MacExpertEncoding**, or **WinAnsiEncoding**,
  or that has an encoding whose **Differences** array includes only
  character names taken from the Adobe standard Latin character set and
  the set of named characters in the Symbol font (see Annex D):

  a)  Map the character code to a character name according to Table D.1
      and the font's **Differences** array.

  b)  Look up the character name in the *Adobe Glyph List* (see the
      Bibliography) to obtain the corresponding Unicode value.

- If the font is a composite font that uses one of the predefined CMaps
  listed in Table 118 (except Identity--H and Identity--V) or whose
  descendant CIDFont uses the Adobe-GB1, Adobe-CNS1, Adobe-Japan1, or
  Adobe-Korea1 character collection:

  a)  Map the character code to a character identifier (CID) according
      to the font's CMap.

  b)  Obtain the registry and ordering of the character collection used
      by the font's CMap (for example, Adobe and Japan1) from its
      **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary.

  c)  Construct a second CMap name by concatenating the registry and
      ordering obtained in step (b) in the format
      *registry*--*ordering*--UCS2 (for example, Adobe--Japan1--UCS2).

  d)  Obtain the CMap with the name constructed in step (c) (available
      from the ASN Web site; see the Bibliography).

  e)  Map the CID obtained in step (a) according to the CMap obtained in
      step (d), producing a Unicode value.

NOTE Type 0 fonts whose descendant CIDFonts use the Adobe-GB1,
Adobe-CNS1, Adobe-Japan1, or AdobeKorea1 character collection (as
specified in the **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary) shall have a supplement
number corresponding to the version of PDF supported by the conforming
reader. See Table 3 for a list of the character collections
corresponding to a given PDF version. (Other supplements of these
character collections can be used, but if the supplement is
higher-numbered than the one corresponding to the supported PDF version,
only the CIDs in the latter supplement are considered to be standard
CIDs.)

If these methods fail to produce a Unicode value, there is no way to
determine what the character code represents in which case a conforming
reader may choose a character code of their choosing.

**9.10.3 ToUnicode CMaps**

The CMap defined in the **ToUnicode** entry of the font dictionary shall
follow the syntax for CMaps introduced in 9.7.5, \"CMaps\" and fully
documented in Adobe Technical Note #5014, *Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files
Specification*. Additional guidance regarding the CMap defined in this
entry is provided in Adobe Technical Note #5411, *ToUnicode Mapping File
Tutorial*. This CMap differs from an ordinary one in these ways:

- The only pertinent entry in the CMap stream dictionary (see Table 120)
  is **UseCMap**, which may be used if the CMap is based on another
  **ToUnicode** CMap.

- The CMap file shall contain **begincodespacerange** and
  **endcodespacerange** operators that are consistent with the encoding
  that the font uses. In particular, for a simple font, the codespace
  shall be one byte long.

- It shall use the **beginbfchar**, **endbfchar**, **beginbfrange**, and
  **endbfrange** operators to define the mapping from character codes to
  Unicode character sequences expressed in UTF-16BE encoding.

EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates a Type 0 font that uses the
Identity-H CMap to map from character codes to CIDs and whose descendant
CIDFont uses the Identity mapping from CIDs to TrueType glyph indices.
Text strings shown using this font simply use a 2-byte glyph index for
each glyph. In the absence of a ToUnicode entry, no information would be
available about what the glyphs mean.

EXAMPLE 2 in this sub-clause illustrates several extensions to the way
destination values may be defined. To support mappings from a source
code to a string of destination codes, this extension has been made to
the ranges defined after a **beginbfchar** operator:

> *n* **beginbfchar** *srcCode* *dstString* **endbfchar**

where *dstString* may be a string of up to 512 bytes. Likewise, mappings
after the **beginbfrange** operator may be defined as:

> *n* **beginbfrange** *srcCode*~1~ *^srcCode^*~2~ *dstString*
> **endbfrange**

In this case, the last byte of the string shall be incremented for each
consecutive code in the source code range.

When defining ranges of this type, the value of the last byte in the
string shall be less than or equal to 255 − (*srcCode*2 − *srcCode*1).
This ensures that the last byte of the string shall not be incremented
past 255; otherwise, the result of mapping is undefined.

To support more compact representations of mappings from a range of
source character codes to a discontiguous range of destination codes,
the CMaps used for the **ToUnicode** entry may use this syntax for the
mappings following a **beginbfrange** definition.

> *n* **beginbfrange** *srcCode*~1~ *srcCode*~2~ \[ *dstString*~1~
> *dstString*~2~ ... *dstString*~m~ \] **endbfrange**

Consecutive codes starting with *srcCode*1 and ending with *srcCode*2
shall be mapped to the destination strings in the array starting with
*dstString*1 and ending with *dstString*m . The value of dstString can
be a string of up to 512 bytes. The value of m represents the number of
continuous character codes in the source character code range.

> *m = srcCode*~2~ - *srcCode*~1~ + 1

## 10 Rendering

### 10.1 General

Nearly all of the rendering facilities that are under the control of a
PDF file pertain to the reproduction of colour. Colours shall be
rendered by a conforming reader using the following multiple-step
process outlined.

NOTE 1 The PDF imaging model separates *graphics* (the specification of
shapes and colours) from rendering

> (controlling a raster output device). Figures 20 and 21 in 8.6.3,
> \"Colour Space Families\" illustrate this division. 8, \"Graphics\"
> describes the facilities for specifying the appearance of pages in a
> device-independent way. This clause describes the facilities for
> controlling how shapes and colours are rendered on the raster output
> device. All of the facilities discussed here depend on the specific
> characteristics of the output device. PDF files that are intended to
> be device-independent should limit themselves to the general graphics
> facilities described in 8, \"Graphics\".

Depending on the current colour space and on the characteristics of the
device, it is not always necessary to perform every step.

a)  If a colour has been specified in a CIE-based colour space (see
    8.6.5, \"CIE-Based Colour Spaces\"), it shall first be transformed
    to the *native colour space* of the raster output device (also
    called its *process colour model*).

b)  If a colour has been specified in a device colour space that is
    inappropriate for the output device (for example, *RGB* colour with
    a *CMYK* or grayscale device), a *colour conversion function* shall
    be invoked.

c)  The device colour values shall now be mapped through *transfer
    functions*, one for each colour component.

NOTE 2 The transfer functions compensate for peculiarities of the output
device, such as nonlinear gray-level response. This step is sometimes
called *gamma correction*.

d)  If the device cannot reproduce continuous tones, but only certain
    discrete colours such as black and white pixels, a *halftone
    function* shall be invoked, which approximates the desired colours
    by means of patterns of pixels.

e)  Finally, *scan conversion* shall be performed to mark the
    appropriate pixels of the raster output device with the requested
    colours.

Once these operations have been performed for all graphics objects on
the page, the resulting raster data shall be used to mark the physical
output medium, such as pixels on a display or ink on a printed page. A
PDF file may specify very little about the properties of the physical
medium on which the output will be produced; that information may be
obtained from the following sources by a conforming reader:

- The media box and a few other entries in the page dictionary (see
  14.11.2, \"Page Boundaries\").

- An interactive dialogue conducted when the user requests viewing or
  printing.

- A *job ticket*, either embedded in the PDF file or provided
  separately, that may specify detailed instructions for imposing PDF
  pages onto media and for controlling special features of the output
  device. Various standards exist for the format of job tickets. Two of
  them, JDF (Job Definition Format) and PJTF (Portable Job Ticket
  Format), are described in the CIP4 document *JDF Specification* and in
  Adobe Technical Note #5620, *Portable Job Ticket Format* (see the
  Bibliography), respectively.

Table 58 in 8.4.5, \"Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries\" lists the
various device-dependent graphics state parameters that may be used to
control certain aspects of rendering. To invoke these parameters, the
**gs** operator shall be used.

### 10.2 CIE-Based Colour to Device Colour

To render CIE-based colours on an output device, the conforming reader
shall convert from the specified CIEbased colour space to the device's
native colour space (typically **DeviceGray**, **DeviceRGB**, or
**DeviceCMYK**), taking into account the known properties of the device.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

| 1    | > CIE-based colour is based on a model of human colour    |

|      | > that accurately reproduces the requested CIE-based      |
|      | > colour values as perceived by a human observer.         |
|      | > CIEbased colour specification and rendering are a       |
|      | > feature of PDF 1.1 (**CalGray**, **CalRGB**, and        |
|      | > **Lab**) and PDF 1.3 (ICCBased).                        |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | The conversion from CIE-based colour to device colour is  |
| 2    | complex, and the theory on which it is based is beyond    |
|      | the scope of this specification. The algorithm has many   |
|      | parameters, including an optional, full threedimensional  |
|      | colour lookup table. The colour fidelity of the output    |
|      | depends on having these parameters properly set, usually  |
|      | by a method that includes some form of calibration. The   |
|      | colours that a device can produce are characterized by a  |
|      | *device profile*, which is usually specified by an ICC    |
|      | profile associated with the device (and entirely separate |
|      | from the profile that is specified in an **ICCBased**     |
|      | colour space).                                            |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | PDF has no equivalent of the PostScript colour rendering  |
| 3    | dictionary. The means by which a device profile is        |
|      | associated with a conforming reader's output device are   |
|      | implementation-dependent and not specified in a PDF file. |
|      | Typically, this is done through a colour management       |
|      | system (CMS) that is provided by the operating system.    |
|      | Beginning with PDF 1.4, a PDF file can also specify one   |
|      | or more output intents providing possible profiles that   |
|      | may be used to process the file (see 14.11.5, \"Output    |
|      | Intents\").                                               |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Conversion from a CIE-based colour value to a device colour value
requires two main operations:

a)  The CIE-based colour value shall be adjusted according to a
    *CIE-based gamut mapping function.*

NOTE 4 A *gamut* is a subset of all possible colours in some colour
space. A page description has a *source gamut* consisting of all the
colours it uses. An output device has a *device gamut* consisting of all
the colours it can reproduce. This step transforms colours from the
source gamut to the device gamut in a way that attempts to preserve
colour appearance, visual contrast, or some other explicitly specified
*rendering intent* (see 8.6.5.8, \"Rendering Intents\").

b)  A corresponding device colour value shall be generated according to
    a *CIE-based colour mapping function.* For a given CIE-based colour
    value, this function shall compute a colour value in the device's
    native colour space.

The CIE-based gamut and colour mapping functions shall be applied only
to colour values presented in a CIEbased colour space. Colour values in
device colour spaces directly control the device colour components
though this may be altered by the **DefaultGray**, **DefaultRGB**, and
**DefaultCMYK** colour space resources (see 8.6.5.6, \"Default Colour
Spaces\").

The source gamut shall be specified by the information contained in the
definition of the CIE-based colour space when selected. This
specification shall be device-independent. The corresponding properties
of the output device shall be given in the device profile associated
with the device. The gamut mapping and colour mapping functions are part
of the implementation of the conforming reader.

### 10.3 Conversions among Device Colour Spaces

**10.3.1 General**

Each raster output device has a *native colour space*, which typically
is one of the standard device colour spaces (**DeviceGray**,
**DeviceRGB**, or **DeviceCMYK**). In other words, most devices support
reproduction of colours according to a grayscale (monochrome), *RGB*
(red-green-blue), or *CMYK* (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) model. If the
device supports continuous-tone output, reproduction shall occur
directly. Otherwise, it shall be accomplished by means of halftoning.

A device's native colour space is also called its *process colour
model*. Process colours are ones that are produced by combinations of
one or more standard *process colorants*. Colours specified in any
device or CIEbased colour space shall be rendered as process colours. A
device may also support additional *spot colorants*, which shall be
painted only by means of **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour spaces.
They shall not be involved in the rendering of device or CIE-based
colour spaces, nor shall they be subject to the conversions described in
the Note.

NOTE Some devices provide a native colour space that is not one of the
three named previously but consists of a different combination of
colorants. In that case, conversion from the standard device colour
spaces to the device's native colour space may be performed by the
conforming reader in a manner of its own choosing.

Knowing the native colour space and other output capabilities of the
device, the conforming reader shall automatically convert the colour
values specified in a file to those appropriate for the device's native
colour space. If the file specifies colours directly in the device's
native colour space, no conversions shall be performed.

EXAMPLE If a file specifies colours in the **DeviceRGB** colour space
but the device supports grayscale (such as a monochrome display) or
*CMYK* (such as a colour printer), the conforming reader shall perform
the necessary conversions.

The algorithms used to convert among device colour spaces are very
simple. As perceived by a human viewer, these conversions produce only
crude approximations of the original colours. More sophisticated control
over colour conversion may be achieved by means of CIE-based colour
specification and rendering. Additionally, device colour spaces may be
remapped into CIE-based colour spaces (see 8.6.5.6, \"Default Colour
Spaces\").

**10.3.2 Conversion between DeviceGray and DeviceRGB**

Black, white, and intermediate shades of gray can be considered special
cases of *RGB* colour. A grayscale value shall be described by a single
number: 0.0 corresponds to black, 1.0 to white, and intermediate values
to different gray levels.

A gray level shall be equivalent to an *RGB* value with all three
components the same. In other words, the *RGB* colour value equivalent
to a specific gray value shall be

> *red* = *gray green* = *gray blue* = *gray*

The gray value for a given *RGB* value shall be computed according to
the NTSC video standard, which determines how a colour television signal
is rendered on a black-and-white television set:

> *gray* = 0.3 × *red* + 0.59 × *green* + 0.11 × *blu*

**10.3.3 Conversion between DeviceGray and DeviceCMYK**

Nominally, a gray level is the complement of the black component of
*CMYK*. Therefore, the *CMYK* colour value equivalent to a specific gray
level shall be

> *cyan* = 0.0 *magenta* = 0.0 *yellow* = 0.0
>
> *black* = 1.0 -- *gray*

To obtain the equivalent gray level for a given *CMYK* value, the
contributions of all components shall be taken into account:

> *gray* = 1.0 -- min(1.0^·^ , 0.3 × *cyan* + 0.59 × *magenta* + 0.11 ×
> *yellow* + *black*

The interactions between the black component and the other three are
elaborated in 10.3.4.

**10.3.4 Conversion from DeviceRGB to DeviceCMYK**

Conversion of a colour value from *RGB* to *CMYK* is a two-step process.
The first step shall be to convert the red-green-blue value to
equivalent cyan, magenta, and yellow components. The second step shall
be to generate a black component and alter the other components to
produce a better approximation of the original colour.

NOTE 1 The subtractive colour primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow are
the complements of the additive primaries red, green, and blue.

EXAMPLE A cyan ink subtracts the red component of white light. In
theory, the conversion is very simple:

> *cyan* = 1.0 -- *red*
>
> *magenta* = 1.0 -- *green*
>
> *yellow* = 1.0 -- *blue*
>
> A colour that is 0.2 red, 0.7 green, and 0.4 blue can also be
> expressed as 1.0 − 0.2 = 0.8 cyan, 1.0 − 0.7 = 0.3 magenta, and 1.0 −
> 0.4 = 0.6 yellow.

NOTE 2 Logically, only cyan, magenta, and yellow are needed to generate
a printing colour. An equal level of cyan, magenta, and yellow should
create the equivalent level of black. In practice, however, coloured
printing inks do not mix perfectly; such combinations often form dark
brown shades instead of true black. To obtain a truer colour rendition
on a printer, true black ink is often substituted for the mixed-black
portion of a colour. Most colour printers support a black component (the
*K* component of *CMYK*). Computing the quantity of this component
requires some additional steps:

> *Black generation* calculates the amount of black to be used when
> trying to reproduce a particular colour.
>
> *Undercolor removal* reduces the amounts of the cyan, magenta, and
> yellow components to compensate for the amount of black that was added
> by black generation.

The complete conversion from *RGB* to *CMYK* shall be as follows, where
*BG* (*k*) and *UCR* (*k*) are invocations of the black-generation and
undercolor-removal functions, respectively:

> *c* = 1.0 -- *red*
>
> *m* = 1.0 -- *green y* = 1.0 -- *blue k* = min(*c m y*, , )

*cyan* = min 1.0 max 0.0( , ( , *c* -- *UCR k*( )))

*magenta* = min 1.0 max 0.0( , ( , *m* -- *UCR k*( )))

*yellow* = min 1.0 max 0.0( , ( , *y* -- *UCR k*( )))

*black* = min 1.0 max 0.0( , ( , *BG k*( )))

The black-generation and undercolor-removal functions shall be defined
as PDF function dictionaries (see 7.10, \"Functions\") that are
parameters in the graphics state. They shall be specified as the values
of the **BG** and **UCR** (or **BG2** and **UCR2**) entries in a
graphics state parameter dictionary (see Table 58). Each function shall
be called with a single numeric operand and shall return a single
numeric result.

The input of both the black-generation and undercolor-removal functions
shall be *k*, the minimum of the intermediate *c*, *m*, and *y* values
that have been computed by subtracting the original *red*, *green*, and
*blue* components from 1.0.

NOTE 3 Nominally, *k* is the amount of black that can be removed from
the cyan, magenta, and yellow components and substituted as a separate
black component.

The black-generation function shall compute the black component as a
function of the nominal *k* value. It may simply return its *k* operand
unchanged, or it may return a larger value for extra black, a smaller
value for less black, or 0.0 for no black at all.

The undercolor-removal function shall compute the amount to subtract
from each of the intermediate *c*, *m*, and *y* values to produce the
final cyan, magenta, and yellow components. It may simply return its *k*
operand unchanged, or it may return 0.0 (so that no colour is removed),
some fraction of the black amount, or even a negative amount, thereby
adding to the total amount of colorant.

The final component values that result after applying black generation
and undercolor removal should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. If a value
falls outside this range, the nearest valid value shall be substituted
automatically without error indication.

NOTE 4 This substitution is indicated explicitly by the *min* and *max*
operations in the preceding formulas.

The correct choice of black-generation and undercolor-removal functions
depends on the characteristics of the output device. Each device shall
be configured with default values that are appropriate for that device.

NOTE 5 See 11.7.5, \"Rendering Parameters and Transparency\" and, in
particular, 11.7.5.3, \"Rendering Intent and Colour Conversions\" for
further discussion of the role of black-generation and
undercolor-removal functions in the transparent imaging model.

**10.3.5 Conversion from DeviceCMYK to DeviceRGB**

Conversion of a colour value from *CMYK* to *RGB* is a simple operation
that does not involve black generation or undercolour removal:

*red* = 1.0 -- min 1.0( , *cyan* + *black*)

*green* = 1.0 -- min 1.0( , *magenta* + *black*)

*blue* = 1.0 -- min 1.0( , *yellow* + *black*)

The black component shall be added to each of the other components,
which shall then be converted to their complementary colours by
subtracting them each from 1.0.

### 10.4 Transfer Functions

In the sequence of steps for processing colours, the conforming reader
shall apply the transfer function *after* performing any needed
conversions between colour spaces, but *before* applying a halftone
function, if necessary. Each colour component shall have its own
separate transfer function; there shall not be interaction between
components.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 Starting with PDF 1.2, a *transfer function* may be used to
         adjust the values of colour components to compensate for
         nonlinear response in an output device and in the human
         eye. Each component of a device colour space---for example,
         the red component of the **DeviceRGB** space---is intended
         to represent the perceived lightness or intensity of that
         colour component in proportion to the component's numeric
         value.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 Many devices do not actually behave this way, however; the
         purpose of a transfer function is to compensate for the
         device's actual behaviour. This operation is sometimes
         called *gamma correction* (not to be confused with the
         *CIE-based gamut mapping function* performed as part of
         CIE-based colour rendering).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

Transfer functions shall always operate in the native colour space of
the output device, regardless of the colour space in which colours were
originally specified. (For example, for a *CMYK* device, the transfer
functions apply to the device's cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colour
components, even if the colours were originally specified in, for
example, a **DeviceRGB** or **CalRGB** colour space.) The transfer
function shall be called with a numeric operand in the range 0.0 to 1.0
and shall return a number in the same range. The input shall be the
value of a colour component in the device's native colour space, either
specified directly or produced by conversion from some other colour
space. The output shall be the transformed component value to be
transmitted to the device (after halftoning, if necessary).

Both the input and the output of a transfer function shall always be
interpreted as if the corresponding colour component were additive (red,
green, blue, or gray): the greater the numeric value, the lighter the
colour. If the component is subtractive (cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
or a spot colour), it shall be converted to additive form by subtracting
it from 1.0 before it is passed to the transfer function. The output of
the function shall always be in additive form and shall be passed on to
the halftone function in that form.

Starting with PDF 1.2, transfer functions shall be defined as PDF
function objects (see 7.10, \"Functions\"). There are two ways to
specify transfer functions:

- The *current transfer function* parameter in the graphics state shall
  consist of either a single transfer function or an array of four
  separate transfer functions, one each for red, green, blue, and gray
  or their complements cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. If only a
  single function is specified, it shall apply to all components. An
  *RGB* device shall use the first three, a monochrome device shall use
  the gray transfer function only, and a *CMYK* device shall use all
  four. The current transfer function may be specified as the value of
  the **TR** or **TR2** entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary;
  see Table 58.

- The *current halftone* parameter in the graphics state may specify
  transfer functions as optional entries in *halftone dictionaries* (see
  10.5.5, \"Halftone Dictionaries\"). This is the only way to set
  transfer functions for nonprimary colour components or for any
  component in devices whose native colour space uses components other
  than the ones listed previously. A transfer function specified in a
  halftone dictionary shall override the corresponding one specified by
  the current transfer function parameter in the graphics state.

In addition to their intended use for gamma correction, transfer
functions may be used to produce a variety of special, device-dependent
effects. Because transfer functions produce device-dependent effects, a
page description that is intended to be device-independent shall not
alter them.

When the current colour space is DeviceGray and the output device's
native colour space is DeviceCMYK, a conforming reader shall use only
the gray transfer function. The normal conversion from DeviceGray to
DeviceCMYK produces 0.0 for the cyan, magenta, and yellow components.
These components shall not be passed through their respective transfer
functions but are rendered directly, producing output containing no
coloured inks. This special case exists for compatibility with existing
conforming readers that use a transfer function to obtain special
effects on monochrome devices, and shall apply only to colours specified
in the DeviceGray colour space.

NOTE 3 See 11.7.5, \"Rendering Parameters and Transparency\" and, in
particular, 11.7.5.2, \"Halftone and Transfer Function\" for further
discussion of the role of transfer functions in the transparent imaging
model.

### 10.5 Halftones

**10.5.1 General**

*Halftoning* is a process by which continuous-tone colours are
approximated on an output device that can achieve only a limited number
of discrete colours. Colours that the device cannot produce directly are
simulated by using patterns of pixels in the colours available.

NOTE 1 Perhaps the most familiar example is the rendering of gray tones
with black and white pixels, as in a newspaper photograph.

Some output devices can reproduce continuous-tone colours directly.
Halftoning is not required for such devices; after gamma correction by
the transfer functions, the colour components shall be transmitted
directly to the device. On devices that do require halftoning, it shall
occur after all colour components have been transformed by the
applicable transfer functions. The input to the halftone function shall
consist of continuoustone, gamma-corrected colour components in the
device's native colour space. Its output shall consist of pixels in
colours the device can reproduce.

PDF provides a high degree of control over details of the halftoning
process.

NOTE 2 When rendering on low-resolution displays, fine control over
halftone patterns is needed to achieve the best approximations of gray
levels or colours and to minimize visual artifacts.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 3 In colour printing, independent halftone screens can be
         specified for each of several colorants.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 4 Remember that everything pertaining to halftones is, by
         definition, device-dependent. In general, when a PDF file
         provides its own halftone specifications, it sacrifices
         portability. Associated with every output device is a
         default halftone definition that is appropriate for most
         purposes. Only relatively sophisticated files need to
         define their own halftones to achieve special effects. For
         correct results, a PDF file that defines a new halftone
         depends on certain assumptions about the resolution and
         orientation of device space. The best choice of halftone
         parameters often depends on specific physical properties of
         the output device, such as pixel shape, overlap between
         pixels, and the effects of electronic or mechanical noise.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

All halftones are defined in device space, and shall be unaffected by
the current transformation matrix.

**10.5.2 Halftone Screens**

In general, halftoning methods are based on the notion of a *halftone
screen*, which divides the array of device pixels into *cells* that may
be modified to produce the desired halftone effects. A screen is defined
by conceptually laying a uniform rectangular grid over the device pixel
array. Each pixel belongs to one cell of the grid; a single cell
typically contains many pixels. The screen grid shall be defined
entirely in device space and shall be unaffected by modifications to the
current transformation matrix.

NOTE This property is essential to ensure that adjacent areas coloured
by halftones are properly stitched together without visible seams.

On a bilevel (black-and-white) device, each cell of a screen may be made
to approximate a shade of gray by painting some of the cell's pixels
black and some white. Numerically, the gray level produced within a cell
shall be the ratio of white pixels to the total number of pixels in the
cell. A cell containing *n* pixels can render *n* + 1 different gray
levels, ranging from all pixels black to all pixels white. A gray value
*g* in the range 0.0 to 1.0 shall be produced by making *i* pixels
white, where *i* = floor (*g* × *n*).

The foregoing description also applies to colour output devices whose
pixels consist of primary colours that are either completely on or
completely off. Most colour printers, but not colour displays, work this
way. Halftoning shall be applied to each colour component independently,
producing shades of that colour.

Colour components shall be presented to the halftoning machinery in
additive form, regardless of whether they were originally specified
additively (*RGB* or gray) or subtractively (*CMYK* or tint). Larger
values of a colour component represent lighter colours---greater
intensity in an additive device such as a display or less ink in a
subtractive device such as a printer. Transfer functions produce colour
values in additive form; see 10.4, \"Transfer Functions\".

**10.5.3 Spot Functions**

A common way of defining a halftone screen is by specifying a
*frequency*, *angle*, and *spot function*. The frequency indicates the
number of halftone cells per inch; the angle indicates the orientation
of the grid lines relative to the device coordinate system. As a cell's
desired gray level varies from black to white, individual pixels within
the cell change from black to white in a well-defined sequence: if a
particular gray level includes certain white pixels, lighter grays will
include the same white pixels along with some additional ones. The order
in which pixels change from black to white for increasing gray levels
shall be determined by a *spot function*, which specifies that order in
an indirect way that minimizes interactions with the screen frequency
and angle.

Consider a halftone cell to have its own coordinate system: the centre
of the cell is the origin and the corners are at coordinates ±1.0
horizontally and vertically. Each pixel in the cell is centred at
horizontal and vertical coordinates that both lie in the range −1.0 to
+1.0. For each pixel, the spot function shall be invoked with the
pixel's coordinates as input and shall return a single number in the
range −1.0 to +1.0, defining the pixel's position in the whitening
order.

The specific values the spot function returns are not significant; all
that matters are the *relative* values returned for different pixels. As
a cell's gray level varies from black to white, the first pixel whitened
shall be the one for which the spot function returns the lowest value,
the next pixel shall be the one with the next higher spot function
value, and so on. If two pixels have the same spot function value, their
relative order shall be chosen arbitrarily.

PDF provides built-in definitions for many of the most commonly used
spot functions that a conforming reader shall implement. A halftone may
simply specify any of these predefined spot functions by name instead of
giving an explicit function definition.

EXAMPLE The name **SimpleDot** designates a spot function whose value is
inversely related to a pixel's distance from the center of the halftone
cell. This produces a "dot screen" in which the black pixels are
clustered within a circle whose area is inversely proportional to the
gray level. The name **Line** designates a spot function whose value is
the distance from a given pixel to a line through the center of the
cell, producing a "line screen" in which the white pixels grow away from
that line.

Table 128 shows the predefined spot functions. The table gives the
mathematical definition of each function along with the corresponding
PostScript language code as it would be defined in a PostScript
calculator function (see 7.10.5, \"Type 4 (PostScript Calculator)
Functions\"). The image accompanying each function shows how the
relative values of the function are distributed over the halftone cell,
indicating the approximate order in which pixels are whitened. Pixels
corresponding to darker points in the image are whitened later than
those corresponding to lighter points.

**10.5.4 Threshold Arrays**

Another way to define a halftone screen is with a *threshold array* that
directly controls individual device pixels in a halftone cell. This
technique provides a high degree of control over halftone rendering. It
also permits halftone cells to be arbitrary rectangles, whereas those
controlled by a spot function are always square.

A threshold array is much like a sampled image---a rectangular array of
pixel values---but shall be defined entirely in device space. Depending
on the halftone type, the threshold values occupy 8 or 16 bits each.
Threshold values nominally represent gray levels in the usual way, from
0 for black up to the maximum (255 or 65,535) for white. The threshold
array shall be replicated to tile the entire device space: each pixel in
device space shall be mapped to a particular sample in the threshold
array. On a bilevel device, where each pixel is either black or white,
halftoning with a threshold array shall proceed as follows:

a)  For each device pixel that is to be painted with some gray level,
    consult the corresponding threshold value from the threshold array.

b)  If the requested gray level is less than the threshold value, paint
    the device pixel black; otherwise, paint it white. Gray levels in
    the range 0.0 to 1.0 correspond to threshold values from 0 to the
    maximum available (255 or 65,535).

A threshold value of 0 shall be treated as if it were 1; therefore, a
gray level of 0.0 paints all pixels black, regardless of the values in
the threshold array.

This scheme easily generalizes to monochrome devices with multiple bits
per pixel, where each pixel can directly represent intermediate gray
levels in addition to black and white. For any device pixel that is
specified with some in-between gray level, the halftoning algorithm
shall consult the corresponding value in the threshold array to
determine whether to use the next-lower or next-higher representable
gray level. In this situation, the threshold values do not represent
absolute gray levels, but rather gradations between any two adjacent
representable gray levels.

EXAMPLE If there are 2 bits per pixel, each pixel can directly represent
one of four different gray levels: black, dark gray, light gray, or
white, encoded as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

NOTE A halftone defined in this way can also be used with colour
displays that have a limited number of values for each colour component.
The red, green, and blue components are simply treated independently as
gray levels, applying the appropriate threshold array to each. (This
technique also works for a screen defined as a spot function, since the
spot function is used to compute a threshold array internally.)

**10.5.5 Halftone Dictionaries**

> **10.5.5.1 General**

In PDF 1.2, the graphics state includes a *current halftone* parameter,
which determines the halftoning process that a conforming reader shall
use to perform painting operations. The current halftone may be
specified as the value of the **HT** entry in a graphics state parameter
dictionary; see Table 58. It may be defined by either a dictionary or a
stream, depending on the type of halftone; the term *halftone
dictionary* is used generically throughout this clause to refer to
either a dictionary object or the dictionary portion of a stream object.
(The halftones that are defined by streams are specifically identified
as such in the descriptions of particular halftone types; unless
otherwise stated, they are understood to be defined by simple
dictionaries instead.)

Every halftone dictionary shall have a **HalftoneType** entry whose
value shall be an integer specifying the overall type of halftone
definition. The remaining entries in the dictionary are interpreted
according to this type. PDF supports the halftone types listed in Table
129.

> **Table 129 -- PDF halftone types**

  ---------------------------------------------------
  **Type**   **Meaning**
  ---------- ----------------------------------------
  1          Defines a single halftone screen by a
             *frequency, angle*, and *spot function*.

  5          Defines an arbitrary number of halftone
             screens, one for each colorant or colour
             component (including both primary and
             spot colorants). The keys in this
             dictionary are names of colorants; the
             values are halftone dictionaries of
             other types, each defining the halftone
             screen for a single colorant.

  6          Defines a single halftone screen by a
             threshold array containing 8-bit sample
             values.

  10         Defines a single halftone screen by a
             threshold array containing 8-bit sample
             values, representing a halftone cell
             that may have a nonzero screen angle.

  16         *(PDF 1.3)* Defines a single halftone
             screen by a threshold array containing
             16-bit sample values, representing a
             halftone cell that may have a nonzero
             screen angle.
  ---------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 The dictionaries representing these halftone types contain the
same entries as the corresponding PostScript language halftone
dictionaries (as described in Section 7.4 of the PostScript Language
Reference, Third Edition), with the following exceptions:

> The PDF dictionaries may contain a **Type** entry with the value
> *Halftone*, identifying the type of PDF object that the dictionary
> describes.
>
> Spot functions and transfer functions are represented by function
> objects instead of PostScript procedures.
>
> Threshold arrays are specified as streams instead of files.
>
> In type 5 halftone dictionaries, the keys for colorants shall be name
> objects; they may not be strings as they may in PostScript.

Halftone dictionaries have an optional entry, **HalftoneName**, that
identifies the halftone by name. In PDF 1.3, if this entry is present,
all other entries, including **HalftoneType**, are optional. At
rendering time, if the output device has a halftone with the specified
name, that halftone shall be used, overriding any other halftone
parameters specified in the dictionary.

NOTE 2 This provides a way for PDF files to select the proprietary
halftones supplied by some device manufacturers, which would not
otherwise be accessible because they are not explicitly defined in PDF.

If there is no HalftoneName entry, or if the requested halftone name
does not exist on the device, the halftone's parameters shall be defined
by the other entries in the dictionary, if any. If no other entries are
present, the default halftone shall be used.

NOTE 3 See 11.7.5, \"Rendering Parameters and Transparency\" and, in
particular, "Halftone and Transfer Function" in 11.7.5.2 for further
discussion of the role of halftones in the transparent imaging model.

  **TransferFunction**   function or *(Optional)* A transfer function,

                                     function in the graphics state for
                                     the same component. This entry shall
                                     be present if the dictionary is a
                                     component of a type 5 halftone (see
                                     "Type 5 Halftones" in 10.5.5.6) and
                                     represents either a nonprimary or

                                     (see 10.4, \"Transfer Functions\").
                                     The name **Identity** may be used to
                                     specify the identity function.

If the **AccurateScreens** entry has a value of **true**, a highly
precise halftoning algorithm shall be substituted in place of the
standard one. If **AccurateScreens** is **false** or not present,
ordinary halftoning shall be used.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 Accurate halftoning achieves the requested screen frequency
         and angle with very high accuracy, whereas ordinary
         halftoning adjusts them so that a single screen cell is
         quantized to device pixels. High accuracy is important
         mainly for making colour separations on high-resolution
         devices. However, it may be computationally expensive and
         therefore is ordinarily disabled.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 In principle, PDF permits the use of halftone screens with
         arbitrarily large cells---in other words, arbitrarily low
         frequencies. However, cells that are very large relative to
         the device resolution or that are oriented at unfavorable
         angles may exceed the capacity of available memory. If this
         happens, an error occurs. The **AccurateScreens** feature
         often requires very large amounts of memory to achieve the
         highest accuracy.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

> **10.5.5.4 Type 10 Halftones**

Type 6 halftones specify a threshold array with a zero screen angle;
they make no provision for other angles. The type 10 halftone removes
this restriction and allows the use of threshold arrays for halftones
with nonzero screen angles as well.

Halftone cells at nonzero angles can be difficult to specify because
they may not line up well with scan lines and because it may be
difficult to determine where a given sampled point goes. The type 10
halftone addresses these difficulties by dividing the halftone cell into
a pair of squares that line up at zero angles with the output device's
pixel grid. The squares contain the same information as the original
cell but are much easier to store and manipulate. In addition, they can
be mapped easily into the internal representation used for all
rendering.

NOTE 1 Figure 50 shows a halftone cell with a frequency of 38.4 cells
per inch and an angle of 50.2 degrees, represented graphically in device
space at a resolution of 300 dots per inch. Each asterisk in the figure
represents a location in device space that is mapped to a specific
location in the threshold array.

NOTE 2 Figure 51 shows how the halftone cell can be divided into two
squares. If the squares and the original cell are tiled across device
space, the area to the right of the upper square maps exactly into the
empty area of the lower square, and vice versa (see Figure 52). The last
row in the first square is immediately adjacent to the first row in the
second square and starts in the same column.

> **Figure 52 -- Halftone cell and two squares tiled across device
> space**

NOTE 3 Any halftone cell can be divided in this way. The side of the
upper square (X) is equal to the horizontal displacement from a point in
one halftone cell to the corresponding point in the adjacent cell, such
as those marked by asterisks in Figure 52. The side of the lower square
(*Y*) is the vertical displacement between the same two points. The
frequency of a halftone screen constructed from squares with sides *X*
and *Y* is thus given by

> *frequency* =
> *resolution*\-\-\--[\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--]{.underline}-
>
> *X*2 + *Y*2
>
> and the angle by
>
> *angle* = atan ^⎛^\-\--^*Y*\ ⎞^ ⎝*X* ⎠

Like a type 6 halftone, a type 10 halftone shall be represented as a
stream containing the threshold values, with the parameters defining the
halftone specified by entries in the stream dictionary. This dictionary
may contain the entries shown in Table 132 in addition to the usual
entries common to all streams (see Table 5). The **Xsquare** and
**Ysquare** entries replace the type 6 halftone's **Width** and
**Height** entries.

|                      |          | describes; shall be 10 for this     |
|                      |          | type of halftone.                   |
+----------------------+----------+-------------------------------------+
| **HalftoneName**     | byte     | *(Optional)* The name of the        |
|                      | string   | halftone dictionary.                |
+----------------------+----------+-------------------------------------+
| **Xsquare**          | integer  | *(Required)* The side of square     |
|                      |          | *X,* in device pixels; see below.   |
+----------------------+----------+-------------------------------------+
| **Ysquare**          | integer  | *(Required)* The side of square     |

+----------------------+----------+-------------------------------------+
| **TransferFunction** | function | *(Optional)* A transfer function,   |
|                      | or       | which shall override the current    |
|                      |          | transfer function in the graphics   |
|                      | name     | state for the same component. This  |
|                      |          | entry shall be present if the       |
|                      |          | dictionary is a component of a type |
|                      |          | 5 halftone (see "Type 5 Halftones"  |
|                      |          | in 10.5.5.6) and represents either  |
|                      |          | a nonprimary or nonstandard primary |
|                      |          | colour component (see 10.4,         |
|                      |          | \"Transfer Functions\"). The name   |
|                      |          | **Identity** may be used to specify |
|                      |          | the identity function.              |
+----------------------+----------+-------------------------------------+

The **Xsquare** and **Ysquare** entries shall specify the dimensions of
the two squares in device pixels. The stream shall contain **Xsquare**
2 + **Ysquare** 2 bytes, each representing a single threshold value. The
contents of square *X* shall be specified first, followed by those of
square *Y*. Threshold values within each square shall be defined in
device space in the same order as image samples in image space (see
Figure 34), with the first value at device coordinates (0, 0) and
horizontal coordinates changing faster than vertical coordinates.

> **10.5.5.5 Type 16 Halftones**

Like type 10, a type 16 halftone *(PDF 1.3)* defines a halftone screen
with a threshold array and allows nonzero screen angles. In type 16,
however, each element of the threshold array shall be 16 bits wide
instead of 8. This allows the threshold array to distinguish 65,536
levels of colour rather than only 256 levels. The threshold array may
consist of either one rectangle or two rectangles. If two rectangles are
specified, they shall tile the device space as shown in Figure 53. The
last row in the first rectangle shall be immediately adjacent to the
first row in the second and shall start in the same column.

halftone specified by entries in the stream dictionary. This dictionary
may contain the entries shown in Table 133 in addition to the usual
entries common to all streams (see Table 5). The dictionary's **Width**
and **Height** entries define the dimensions of the first (or only)
rectangle. The dimensions of the second, optional rectangle are defined
by the optional entries **Width2** and **Height2**. Each threshold value
shall be represented as 2 bytes, with the high-order byte first. The
stream shall contain 2 × **Width** × **Height** bytes if there is only
one rectangle or 2 × (**Width** × **Height** + **Width2** × **Height2**)
bytes if there are two rectangles. The contents of the first rectangle
are specified first, followed by those of the second rectangle.
Threshold values within each rectangle shall be defined in device space
in the same order as image samples in image space (see Figure 34), with
the first value at device coordinates (0, 0) and horizontal coordinates
changing faster than vertical coordinates.

> **10.5.5.6 Type 5 Halftones**

Some devices, particularly colour printers, require separate halftones
for each individual colorant. Also, devices that can produce named
separations may require individual halftones for each separation.
Halftone dictionaries of type 5 allow individual halftones to be
specified for an arbitrary number of colorants or colour components.

A type 5 halftone dictionary (Table 134) is a composite dictionary
containing independent halftone definitions for multiple colorants. Its
keys shall be name objects representing the names of individual
colorants or colour components. The values associated with these keys
shall be other halftone dictionaries, each defining the halftone screen
and transfer function for a single colorant or colour component. The
component halftone dictionaries shall not be of halftone type 5.

The colorants or colour components represented in a type 5 halftone
dictionary (aside from the Default entry) fall into two categories:

- Primary colour components for the standard native device colour spaces
  (Gray for **DeviceGray**; **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** for
  **DeviceRGB**; **Cyan**, **Magenta**, **Yellow**, and **Black** for
  **DeviceCMYK**;).

- Nonstandard colour components for use as spot colorants in
  **Separation** and **DeviceN** colour spaces. Some of these may also
  be used as process colorants if the native colour space is
  nonstandard.

When a halftone dictionary of some other type appears as the value of an
entry in a type 5 halftone dictionary, it shall apply only to the single
colorant or colour component named by that entry's key. This is in
contrast to such a dictionary's being used as the current halftone
parameter in the graphics state, which shall apply to all colour
components. If nonprimary colorants are requested when the current
halftone is defined by any means other than a type 5 halftone
dictionary, the gray halftone screen and transfer function shall be used
for all such colorants.

EXAMPLE In this example, the halftone dictionaries for the colour
components and for the default all use the same spot function. In this
example, the halftone dictionaries for the colour components and for the
default all use the same spot function.

### 10.6 Scan Conversion Details

**10.6.1 General**

The final step of rendering shall be *scan conversion*. The conforming
reader executes a scan conversion algorithm to paint graphics, text, and
images in the raster memory of the output device.

NOTE The specifics of the scan conversion algorithm are not defined as
part of PDF. Different implementations may perform scan conversion in
different ways; techniques that are appropriate for one device may be
inappropriate for another. Still, it is useful to have a general
understanding of how scan conversion works, particularly when creating
PDF files intended for viewing on a display. At the low resolutions
typical of displays, variations of even one pixel's width can have a
noticeable effect on the appearance of painted shapes.

Most scan conversion details are not under program control, but a few
are; the parameters for controlling them are described here.

**10.6.2 Flatness Tolerance**

The *flatness tolerance* controls the maximum permitted distance in
device pixels between the mathematically correct path and an
approximation constructed from straight line segments, as shown in
Figure 54. Flatness may be specified as the operand of the **i**
operator (see Table 57) or as the value of the **FL** entry in a
graphics state parameter dictionary (see Table 58). It shall be a
positive number.

NOTE 1 Smaller values yield greater precision at the cost of more
computation.

NOTE 2 Although the figure exaggerates the difference between the curved
and flattened paths for the sake of clarity, the purpose of the flatness
tolerance is to control the precision of curve rendering, not to draw
inscribed polygons. If the parameter's value is large enough to cause
visible straight line segments to appear, the result is unpredictable.

> **Figure 54 -- Flatness tolerance**

**10.6.3 Smoothness Tolerance**

The *smoothness tolerance* *(PDF 1.3)* controls the quality of smooth
shading (type 2 patterns and the **sh** operator) and thus indirectly
controls the rendering performance. Smoothness is the allowable colour
error between a shading approximated by piecewise linear interpolation
and the true value of a (possibly nonlinear) shading function. The error
shall be measured for each colour component, and the maximum independent
error shall be used. The allowable error (or tolerance) shall be
expressed as a fraction of the range of the colour component, from 0.0
to 1.0. Thus, a smoothness tolerance of 0.1 represents a tolerance of 10
percent in each colour component. Smoothness may be specified as the
value of the **SM** entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary (see
Table 58).

EXAMPLE Each output device may have internal limits on the maximum and
minimum tolerances attainable. setting smoothness to 1.0 may result in
an internal smoothness of 0.5 on a high-quality colour device, while
setting it to 0.0 on the same device may result in an internal
smoothness of 0.01 if an error of that magnitude is imperceptible on the
device.

+------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > The smoothness tolerance may also interact with the      |
| 1    | > accuracy of colour conversion. In the case of a colour   |
|      | > conversion defined by a sampled function, the conversion |
|      | > function is unknown. Thus the error may be sampled at    |
|      | > too low a frequency, in which case the accuracy defined  |
|      | > by the smoothness tolerance cannot be guaranteed. In     |
|      | > most cases, however, where the conversion function is    |
|      | > smooth and continuous, the accuracy should be within the |
|      | > specified tolerance.                                     |
+:=====+============================================================+
| NOTE | > The effect of the smoothness tolerance is similar to     |
| 2    | > that of the flatness tolerance. However, that flatness   |
|      | > is measured in device-dependent units of pixel width,    |
|      | > whereas smoothness is measured as a fraction of colour   |
|      | > component range.                                         |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+

**10.6.4 Scan Conversion Rules**

The following rules determine which device pixels a painting operation
affects. All references to coordinates and pixels are in device space. A
*shape* is a path to be painted with the current colour or with an
image. Its coordinates are mapped into device space but not rounded to
device pixel boundaries. At this level, curves have been flattened to
sequences of straight lines, and all "insideness" computations have been
performed.

Pixel boundaries always fall on integer coordinates in device space. A
pixel is a square region identified by the location of its corner with
minimum horizontal and vertical coordinates. The region is *half-open*,
meaning that it includes its lower but not its upper boundaries. More
precisely, for any point whose real-number coordinates are (*x*, *y*),
let *i* = floor (*x*) and *j* = floor (*y*). The pixel that contains
this point is the one identified as (*i*, *j*). The region belonging to
that pixel is defined to be the set of points (*x* ′, *y* ′) such that
*i* ≤ *x* ′ \< *i* + 1 and *j* ≤ *y* ′ \< *j* + 1. Like pixels, shapes
to be painted by filling and stroking operations are also treated as
half-open regions that include the boundaries along their "floor" sides,
but not along their "ceiling" sides.

A shape shall be scan-converted by painting any pixel whose square
region intersects the shape, no matter how small the intersection is.
This ensures that no shape ever disappears as a result of unfavourable
placement relative to the device pixel grid, as might happen with other
possible scan conversion rules. The area covered by painted pixels shall
always be at least as large as the area of the original shape. This rule
applies both to fill operations and to strokes with nonzero width.
Zero-width strokes may be done in an implementation-defined manner that
may include fewer pixels than the rule implies.

NOTE 1 Normally, the intersection of two regions is defined as the
intersection of their interiors. However, for purposes of scan
conversion, a filling region is considered to intersect every pixel
through which its boundary passes, even if the interior of the filling
region is empty.

EXAMPLE A zero-width or zero-height rectangle paints a line 1 pixel
wide.

The region of device space to be painted by a sampled image is
determined similarly to that of a filled shape, though not identically.
The conforming reader transforms the image's source rectangle into
device space and defines a half-open region, just as for fill
operations. However, only those pixels whose *centres* lie within the
region shall be painted. The position of the centre of such a pixel---in
other words, the point whose coordinate values have fractional parts of
one-half---shall be mapped back into source space to determine how to
colour the pixel. There shall not be averaging over the pixel area;

NOTE 2 If the resolution of the source image is higher than that of
device space, some source samples may not be used.

For clipping, the clipping region consists of the set of pixels that
would be included by a fill operation. Subsequent painting operations
shall affect a region that is the intersection of the set of pixels
defined by the clipping region with the set of pixels for the region to
be painted.

Scan conversion of character glyphs may be performed by a different
algorithm from the preceding one.

NOTE 3 That font rendering algorithm uses hints in the glyph
descriptions and techniques that are specialized to glyph rasterization.

**10.6.5 Automatic Stroke Adjustment**

When a stroke is drawn along a path, the scan conversion algorithm may
produce lines of nonuniform thickness because of rasterization effects.
In general, the line width and the coordinates of the endpoints,
transformed into device space, are arbitrary real numbers not quantized
to device pixels. A line of a given width can intersect with different
numbers of device pixels, depending on where it is positioned. Figure 55
illustrates this effect.

For best results, it is important to compensate for the rasterization
effects to produce strokes of uniform thickness. This is especially
important in low-resolution display applications. To meet this need, PDF
1.2 provides an optional *automatic stroke adjustment* feature. When
stroke adjustment is enabled, the line width and the coordinates of a
stroke shall automatically be adjusted as necessary to produce lines of
uniform thickness. The thickness shall be as near as possible to the
requested line width---no more than half a pixel different.

> **Figure 55 -- Rasterization without stroke adjustment**

If stroke adjustment is enabled and the requested line width,
transformed into device space, is less than half a pixel, the stroke
shall be rendered as a single-pixel line.

NOTE This is the thinnest line that can be rendered at device
resolution. It is equivalent to the effect produced by setting the line
width to 0 (see 10.6.4, \"Scan Conversion Rules\").

Because automatic stroke adjustment can have a substantial effect on the
appearance of lines, PDF provides means to control whether the
adjustment shall be performed. This may be specified with the stroke
adjustment parameter in the graphics state, set by means of the **SA**
entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary (see 8.4.5, \"Graphics
State Parameter Dictionaries\").

## 11 Transparency

### 11.1 General

The PDF imaging model includes the notion of *transparency*. Transparent
objects do not necessarily obey a strict opaque painting model but may
blend *(composite)* in interesting ways with other overlapping objects.
This clause describes the general transparency model but does not cover
how it is implemented. At various points it uses implementation-like
descriptions to describe how things work, for the purpose of elucidating
the behaviour of the model. The actual implementation will almost
certainly be different from what these descriptions might imply.

NOTE Transparency was added to PDF in version 1.4

The clause is organized as follows:

- 11.2, \"Overview of Transparency,\" introduces the basic concepts of
  the transparency model and its associated terminology.

- 11.3, \"Basic Compositing Computations,\" describes the mathematics
  involved in compositing a single object with its backdrop.

- 11.4, \"Transparency Groups,\" introduces the concept of *transparency
  groups* and describes their properties and behaviour.

- 11.5, \"Soft Masks,\" covers the creation and use of masks to specify
  position-dependent shape and opacity.

- 11.6, \"Specifying Transparency in PDF,\" describes how transparency
  properties are represented in a PDF document.

- 11.7, \"Colour Space and Rendering Issues,\" deals with some specific
  interactions between transparency and other aspects of colour
  specification and rendering.

### 11.2 Overview of Transparency

The original PDF imaging model paints objects (fills, strokes, text, and
images), possibly clipped by a path, opaquely onto a page. The colour of
the page at any point shall be that of the topmost enclosing object,
disregarding any previous objects it may overlap. This effect may
be---and often is---realized simply by rendering objects directly to the
page in the order in which they are specified, with each object
completely overwriting any others that it overlaps.

Under the transparent imaging model, all of the objects on a page may
potentially contribute to the result. Objects at a given point may be
thought of as forming a *transparency stack* (or *stack* for short). The
objects shall be arranged from bottom to top in the order in which they
are specified. The colour of the page at each point shall be determined
by combining the colours of all enclosing objects in the stack according
to *compositing* rules defined by the transparency model.

NOTE 1 The order in which objects are specified determines the stacking
order but not necessarily the order in which the objects are actually
painted onto the page. In particular, the transparency model does not
require a conforming reader to rasterize objects immediately or to
commit to a raster representation at any time before rendering the
entire stack onto the page. This is important, since rasterization often
causes significant loss of information and precision that is best
avoided during intermediate stages of the transparency computation.

A given object shall be composited with a *backdrop*. Ordinarily, the
backdrop consists of the stack of all objects that have been specified
previously. The result of compositing shall then be treated as the
backdrop for the next object. However, within certain kinds of
transparency groups (see "Transparency Groups"), a different backdrop
may be chosen.

During the compositing of an object with its backdrop, the colour at
each point shall be computed using a specified *blend mode*, which is a
function of both the object's colour and the backdrop colour. The blend
mode shall determine how colours interact; different blend modes may be
used to achieve a variety of useful effects. A single blend mode shall
be in effect for compositing all of a given object, but different blend
modes may be applied to different objects.

Two scalar quantities called *shape* and *opacity* mediate compositing
of an object with its backdrop. Conceptually, for each object, these
quantities shall be defined at every point in the plane, just as if they
were additional colour components. (In actual practice, they may be
obtained from auxiliary sources rather than being intrinsic to the
object.)

Both shape and opacity vary from 0.0 (no contribution) to 1.0 (maximum
contribution). At any point where either the shape or the opacity of an
object is equal to 0.0, its colour shall be undefined. At points where
the shape is equal to 0.0, the opacity shall also be undefined. The
shape and opacity shall be subject to compositing rules; therefore, the
stack as a whole also has a shape and opacity at each point.

An object's opacity, in combination with the backdrop's opacity, shall
determine the relative contributions of the backdrop colour, the
object's colour, and the blended colour to the resulting composite
colour. The object's shape shall then determine the degree to which the
composite colour replaces the backdrop colour. Shape values of 0.0 and
1.0 identify points that lie outside and inside a conventional
sharp-edged object; intermediate values are useful in defining
soft-edged objects.

Shape and opacity are conceptually very similar. In fact, they can
usually be combined into a single value, called *alpha*, which controls
both the colour compositing computation and the fading between an object
and its backdrop. However, there are a few situations in which they
shall be treated separately; see 11.4.6, \"Knockout

Groups.\"

NOTE 2 Raster-based implementations may need to maintain a separate
shape parameter to do anti-aliasing properly; it is therefore convenient
to have shape as an explicit part of the model.

One or more consecutive objects in a stack may be collected together
into a *transparency group* (often referred to hereafter simply as a
*group*). The group as a whole may have various properties that modify
the compositing behaviour of objects within the group and their
interactions with its backdrop. An additional blend mode, shape, and
opacity may also be associated with the group as a whole and used when
compositing it with its backdrop. Groups may be nested within other
groups, forming a tree-structured hierarchy.

EXAMPLE Figure L.16 in Annex L illustrates the effects of transparency
grouping. In the upper two figures, three coloured circles are painted
as independent objects with no grouping. At the upper left, the three
objects are painted opaquely (opacity = 1.0); each object completely
replaces its backdrop (including previously painted objects) with its
own colour. At the upper right, the same three independent objects are
painted with an opacity of 0.5, causing them to composite with each
other and with the gray and white backdrop. In the lower two figures,
the three objects are combined as a transparency group. At the lower
left, the individual objects have an opacity of 1.0 within the group,
but the group as a whole is painted in the **Normal** blend mode with an
opacity of 0.5. The objects thus completely overwrite each other within
the group, but the resulting group then composites transparently with
the gray and white backdrop. At the lower right, the objects have an
opacity of 0.5 within the group and thus composite with each other. The
group as a whole is painted against the backdrop with an opacity of 1.0
but in a different blend mode (**HardLight**), producing a different
visual effect.

The colour result of compositing a group may be converted to a
single-component luminosity value and treated as a *soft mask*. Such a
mask may then be used as an additional source of shape or opacity values
for subsequent compositing operations. When the mask is used as a shape,
this technique is known as *soft clipping*; it is a generalization of
the current clipping path in the opaque imaging model (see "Clipping
Path Operators").

The notion of *current page* is generalized to refer to a transparency
group consisting of the entire stack of objects placed on the page,
composited with a backdrop that is pure white and fully opaque.
Logically, this entire stack shall then be rasterized to determine the
actual pixel values to be transmitted to the output device.

NOTE 3 In contexts where a PDF page is treated as a piece of artwork to
be placed on some other page it is treated not as a page but as a group,
whose backdrop may be defined differently from that of a page.

### 11.3 Basic Compositing Computations

**11.3.1 General**

This sub-clause describes the basic computations for compositing a
single object with its backdrop. These computations are extended in
11.4, \"Transparency Groups,\" to cover groups consisting of multiple
objects.

**11.3.2 Basic Notation for Compositing Computations**

In general, variable names in this clause consisting of a lowercase
letter denote a scalar quantity, such as an opacity. Uppercase letters
denote a value with multiple scalar components, such as a colour. In the
descriptions of the basic colour compositing computations, colour values
are generally denoted by the letter *C*, with a mnemonic subscript
indicating which of several colour values is being referred to; for
instance, *C~s~* stands for "source colour." Shape and opacity values
are denoted respectively by the letters *f* (for "*f*orm factor") and
*q* (for "opa*q*ueness")---again with a mnemonic subscript, such as
*q~s~* for "source opacity." The symbol α (alpha) stands for a product
of shape and opacity values.

In certain computations, one or more variables may have undefined
values; for instance, when opacity is equal to zero, the corresponding
colour is undefined. A quantity can also be undefined if it results from
division by zero. In any formula that uses such an undefined quantity,
the quantity has no effect on the ultimate result because it is
subsequently multiplied by zero or otherwise cancelled out. It is
significant that while any arbitrary value may be chosen for such an
undefined quantity, the computation shall not malfunction because of
exceptions caused by overflow or division by zero. The further
convention that 0 ÷ 0 = 0 should also be adopted.

**11.3.3 Basic Compositing Formula**

The primary change in the imaging model to accommodate transparency is
in how colours are painted. In the transparent model, the result of
painting (the *result colour*) is a function of both the colour being
painted (the *source colour*) and the colour it is painted over (the
*backdrop colour*). Both of these colours may vary as a function of
position on the page; however, this sub-clause focuses on some fixed
point on the page and assumes a fixed backdrop and source colour.

This computation uses two other parameters: *alpha*, which controls the
relative contributions of the backdrop and source colours, and the
*blend function*, which specifies how they shall be combined in the
painting operation. The resulting *basic colour compositing formula* (or
just *basic compositing formula* for short) shall determine the result
colour produced by the painting operation:

⎛ αs ⎞ Cb + αα\-\-\--~s~-~r~ × \[(1 -- α~b~) × ^C^~s~ + α~b~ × B C( ~b~,
^C^~s~ )\]

> Cr = ⎜⎝1 -- α\-\-\-\--r ⎟⎠ ×

where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 135.

+--------------+----------------------------------+

This formula represents a simplified form of the compositing formula in
which the shape and opacity values are combined and represented as a
single alpha value; the more general form is presented later. This
function is based on the **over** operation **defined in the article
"Compositing Digital Images," by Porter and Duff (see the
Bibliography)**, extended to include a blend mode in the region of
overlapping coverage. The following subclauses elaborate on the meaning
and implications of this formula.

**11.3.4 Blending Colour Space**

The compositing formula shown in 11.3.3, \"Basic Compositing Formula,\"
represents a vector function: the colours it operates on are represented
in the form of *n*-element vectors, where *n* denotes the number of
components required by the colour space in used in the compositing
process. The *i*th component of the result colour *C~r~* shall be
obtained by applying the compositing formula to the *i*th components of
the constituent colours *C~b~* , *C~s~* , and *B* (*C~b~*, *C~s~* ). The
result of the computation thus depends on the colour space in which the
colours are represented. For this reason, the colour space used for
compositing, called the *blending colour space*, is explicitly made part
of the transparent imaging model. When necessary, backdrop and source
colours shall be converted to the blending colour space before the
compositing computation.

Of the PDF colour spaces described in Section 8.6, the following shall
be supported as blending colour spaces:

- **DeviceGray**

- **DeviceRGB**

- **DeviceCMYK**

- **CalGray**

- **CalRGB**

- **ICCBased** colour spaces equivalent to the preceding (including
  calibrated *CMYK*)

The **Lab** space and **ICCBased** spaces that represent lightness and
chromaticity separately (such as *L\*a\*b\**, *L\*u\*v\**, and *HSV*)
shall not be used as blending colour spaces because the compositing
computations in such spaces do not give meaningful results when applied
separately to each component. In addition, an **ICCBased** space used as
a blending colour space shall be bidirectional; that is, the ICC profile
shall contain both *AToB* and *BToA* transformations.

The blending colour space shall be consulted only for process colours.
Although blending may also be done on individual spot colours specified
in a **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space, such colours shall not
be converted to a blending colour space (except in the case where they
first revert to their alternate colour space, as described under Section
8.6.6.4 and "DeviceN Colour Spaces"). Instead, the specified colour
components shall be blended individually with the corresponding
components of the backdrop.

The blend functions for the various blend modes are defined such that
the range for each colour component shall be 0.0 to 1.0 and that the
colour space shall be additive. When performing blending operations in
subtractive colour spaces (**DeviceCMYK**, **Separation**, and
**DeviceN**), the colour component values shall be complemented
(subtracted from 1.0) before the blend function is applied and the
results of the function shall then be complemented back before being
used.

NOTE This adjustment makes the effects of the various blend modes
numerically consistent across all colour spaces. However, the actual
visual effect produced by a given blend mode still depends on the colour
space. Blending in a device colour space produces device-dependent
results, whereas in a CIE-based space it produces results that are
consistent across all devices. See 11.7, \"Colour Space and Rendering
Issues,\" for additional details concerning colour spaces.

**11.3.5 Blend Mode**

In principle, any function of the backdrop and source colours that
yields another colour, *C~r~*, for the result may be used as a blend
function *B* (*C~b~* , *C~s~*), in the compositing formula to customize
the blending operation. PDF defines a standard set of named blend
functions, or *blend modes*, listed in Tables 136 and 137. Figures L.18
and L.19 in Annex L illustrate the resulting visual effects for *RGB*
and *CMYK* colours, respectively.

A blend mode is termed *separable* if each component of the result
colour is completely determined by the corresponding components of the
constituent backdrop and source colours---that is, if the blend mode
function *B* is applied separately to each set of corresponding
components:

> c~r~ = B c( ~b~, c~s~ )

where the lowercase variables *c~r~* , *c~b~* , and *c~s~* denote
corresponding components of the colours *C~r~* , *C~b~* , and *C~s~* ,
expressed in additive form. A separable blend mode may be used with any
colour space, since it applies independently to any number of
components. Only separable blend modes shall be used for blending spot
colours.

NOTE 1 Theoretically, a blend mode could have a different function for
each colour component and still be separable; however, none of the
standard PDF blend modes have this property.

Table 136 lists the standard separable blend modes available in PDF and
the algorithms/formulas that shall be used in the calculation of blended
colours.

Table 137 lists the standard nonseparable blend modes. Since the
nonseparable blend modes consider all colour components in combination,
their computation depends on the blending colour space in which the
components are interpreted. They may be applied to all
multiple-component colour spaces that are allowed as blending colour
spaces (see "Blending Colour Space").

NOTE 2 All of these blend modes conceptually entail the following steps:

a)  Convert the backdrop and source colours from the blending colour
    space to an intermediate *HSL* (huesaturation-luminosity)
    representation.

b)  Create a new colour from some combination of hue, saturation, and
    luminosity components selected from the backdrop and source colours.

c)  Convert the result back to the original (blending) colour space.

> However, the following formulas given do not actually perform these
> conversions. Instead, they start with whichever colour (backdrop or
> source) is providing the hue for the result; then they adjust this
> colour to have the proper saturation and luminosity.

The nonseparable blend mode formulas make use of several auxiliary
functions. These functions operate on colours that are assumed to have
red, green, and blue components. Blending of *CMYK* colour spaces
requires special treatment, as described in this sub-clause.

These functions shall have the following definitions:

Lum C( ) = 0.3 × C~red~ + 0.59 × C~green~ + 0.11 × C~blue~

> SetLum C l( , ) let d = l -- Lum C( )
>
> Cred = Cred + d
>
> Cgreen = Cgreen + d Cblue = Cblue + d

returnClipColor C( )

> ClipColor C( ) let l = Lum C( )
>
> let n = min C( red, Cgreen, Cblue) let x = max C( red, Cgreen, Cblue)
> if n \< 0.0
>
> C~red~ = l + (((C~red~ -- l) × l) ⁄ (l -- n))
>
> C~green~ = l + (((C~green~ -- l) × l) ⁄ (l -- n))
>
> C~blue~ = l + (((C~blue~ -- l) × l) ⁄ (l -- n)) if x \> 1.0
>
> C~red~ = l + (((C~red~ -- l) × (1 -- l)) ⁄ (x -- l))
>
> C~green~ = l + (((C~green~ -- l) × (1 -- l)) ⁄ (x -- l))
>
> C~blue~ = l + (((C~blue~ -- l) × (1 -- l)) ⁄ (x -- l)) return C

Sat C( ) = max C( red, Cgreen, Cblue) -- min C( red, Cgreen, Cblue)

The subscripts *min*, *mid*, and *max* (in the next function) refer to
the colour components having the minimum, middle, and maximum values
upon entry to the function.

> SetSat C s( , ) if Cmax \> Cmin
>
> Cmid = (((Cmid -- Cmin) × s) ⁄ (Cmax -- Cmin)) C~max~ = s else
>
> C~mid~ = C~max~ = 0.0 C~min~ = 0.0 return C

The formulas in this sub-clause apply to *RGB* spaces. Blending in
*CMYK* spaces (including both **DeviceCMYK** and **ICCBased** calibrated
*CMYK* spaces) shall be handled in the following way:

- The *C*, *M*, and *Y* components shall be converted to their
  complementary *R*, *G*, and *B* components in the usual way. The
  preceding formulas shall be applied to the *RGB* colour values. The
  results shall be converted back to *C*, *M*, and *Y*.

- For the *K* component, the result shall be the *K* component of *C~b~*
  for the **Hue**, **Saturation**, and **Color** blend modes; it shall
  be the *K* component of *C*~s~ for the **Luminosity** blend mode.

**11.3.6 Interpretation of Alpha**

The colour compositing formula

⎛ αs ⎞ α

Cr = ⎜⎝1 -- α\-\-\-\--r ⎠⎟ × Cb + α\-\-\--s-r × \[(1 -- αb) × Cs + αb ×
B C( b, Cs )\]

produces a result colour that is a weighted average of the backdrop
colour, the source colour, and the blended *B* (*C~b~* , *C~s~* ) term,
with the weighting determined by the backdrop and source alphas α~β~ and
α*~s~* . For the simplest blend mode, **Normal**, defined by

> B c( ·b, cs ) = cs

the compositing formula collapses to a simple weighted average of the
backdrop and source colours, controlled by the backdrop and source alpha
values. For more interesting blend functions, the backdrop and source
alphas control whether the effect of the blend mode is fully realized or
is toned down by mixing the result with the backdrop and source colours.

The result alpha, α~ρ~ , actually represents a computed result,
described in 11.3.7, \"Shape and Opacity

Computations.\" The result colour shall be normalized by the result
alpha, ensuring that when this colour and alpha are subsequently used
together in another compositing operation, the colour's contribution is
correctly represented.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > If α~ρ~ is zero, the result colour is undefined.        |
| 1    |                                                           |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | The preceding formula represents a simplification of the  |
| 2    | following formula, which presents the relative            |
|      | contributions of backdrop, source, and blended colours in |
|      | a more straightforward way:                               |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

α~r~ × ^C^~r~ = \[(1 -- α~s~) × α~b~ × ^C^~b~\] + \[(1 -- α~b~) × α~s~ ×
^C^~s~\] + \[α~b~ × α~s~ × B C( ~b~, ^C^~s~ )

> = 0.0 or α~β~ = 0.0 results in no blend mode effect; setting α*~s~* =
> 1.0 and α~β~ = 1.0 results in maximum blend mode effect.

**11.3.7 Shape and Opacity Computations**

> **11.3.7.1 General**

As stated earlier, the alpha values that control the compositing process
shall be defined as the product of shape and opacity:

> α~b~ = fb × ^q^b α~r~ = fr × qr
>
> α~s~ = fs × qs

This sub-clause examines the various shape and opacity values
individually. Once again, keep in mind that conceptually these values
are computed for every point on the page.

> **11.3.7.2 Source Shape and Opacity**

Shape and opacity values may come from several sources. The transparency
model provides for three independent sources for each. However, the PDF
representation imposes some limitations on the ability to specify all of
these sources independently (see "Specifying Shape and Opacity").

- *Object shape*. Elementary objects such as strokes, fills, and text
  have an intrinsic shape, whose value shall be 1.0 for points inside
  the object and 0.0 outside. Similarly, an image with an explicit mask
  (see "Explicit Masking") has a shape that shall be 1.0 in the unmasked
  portions and 0.0 in the masked portions. The shape of a group object
  shall be the union of the shapes of the objects it contains.

NOTE 1 Mathematically, elementary objects have "hard" edges, with a
shape value of either 0.0 or 1.0 at every point. However, when such
objects are rasterized to device pixels, the shape values along the
boundaries may be anti-aliased, taking on fractional values representing
fractional coverage of those pixels. When such antialiasing is
performed, it is important to treat the fractional coverage as shape
rather than opacity.

- *Mask shape*. Shape values for compositing an object may be taken from
  an additional source, or *soft mask*, independent of the object
  itself, as described in 11.5, \"Soft Masks.\"

NOTE 2 The use of a soft mask to modify the shape of an object or group,
called *soft clipping*, can produce effects such as a gradual transition
between an object and its backdrop, as in a vignette.

- *Constant shape*. The source shape may be modified at every point by a
  scalar *shape constant*.

NOTE 3 This is merely a convenience, since the same effect could be
achieved with a shape mask whose value is the same everywhere.

- *Object opacity*. Elementary objects have an opacity of 1.0
  everywhere. The opacity of a group object shall be the result of the
  opacity computations for all of the objects it contains.

- *Mask opacity*. Opacity values, like shape values, may be provided by
  a soft mask independent of the object being composited.

- *Constant opacity*. The source opacity may be modified at every point
  by a scalar *opacity constant*.

NOTE 4 It is useful to think of this value as the "current opacity,"
analogous to the current colour used when painting elementary objects.

All of the shape and opacity inputs shall have values in the range 0.0
to 1.0 (inclusive), with a default value of 1.0.

The three shape inputs shall be multiplied together, producing an
intermediate value called the source shape.

> fs = fj × fm × fk

The three opacity inputs shall be multiplied together, producing an
intermediate value called the source opacity.

> qs = qj × qm × qk

+--------------+----------------------------------+

NOTE 5 The effect of each of these inputs is that the painting operation
becomes more transparent as the input values decreases.

When an object is painted with a tiling pattern, the object shape and
object opacity for points in the object's interior are determined by
those of corresponding points in the pattern, rather than being 1.0
everywhere (see "Patterns and Transparency").

> **11.3.7.3 Result Shape and Opacity**

In addition to a result colour, the painting operation also shall
compute an associated *result shape* and *result opacity*. These
computations shall be based on the *union function*

> Union b s( , ) = 1 -- \[(1 -- b) × (1 -- s)\]
>
> = b + s -- (b × s)

where *b* and *s* shall be the backdrop and source values to be
composited.

NOTE 1 This is a generalization of the conventional concept of union for
opaque shapes, and it can be thought of as an "inverted
multiplication"---a multiplication with the inputs and outputs
complemented. The result tends toward 1.0: if either input is 1.0, the
result is 1.0.

The result shape and opacity shall be given by

> f~r~ = Union f( ~b~, f~s~ )
>
> ^q^~r~ =
> \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--Union

These formulas shall be interpreted as follows:

- The result shape shall be the union of the backdrop and source shapes.

- The result opacity shall be the union of the backdrop and source
  opacities, weighted by their respective shapes. The result shall then
  be divided by (normalized by) the result shape.

NOTE 2 Since alpha is just the product of shape and opacity, it can
easily be shown that

**11.3.8 Summary of Basic Compositing Computations**

This sub-clause is a summary of all the computations presented in this
sub-clause. They are given in an order such that no variable is used
before it is computed; also, some of the formulas have been rearranged
to simplify them. See Tables 135, 138, and 139 for the meanings of the
variables used in these formulas.

### 11.4 Transparency Groups

**11.4.1 General**

A *transparency group* is a sequence of consecutive objects in a
transparency stack that shall be collected together and composited to
produce a single colour, shape, and opacity at each point. The result
shall then be treated as if it were a single object for subsequent
compositing operations. Groups may be nested within other groups to form
a tree-structured group hierarchy.

NOTE This facilitates creating independent pieces of artwork, each
composed of multiple objects, and then combining them, possibly with
additional transparency effects applied during the combination.

The objects contained within a group shall be treated as a separate
transparency stack called the *group stack*. The objects in the stack
shall be composited against an initial backdrop (discussed later),
producing a composite colour, shape, and opacity for the group as a
whole. The result is an object whose shape is the union of the shapes of
its constituent objects and whose colour and opacity are the result of
the compositing operations. This object shall then be composited with
the group's backdrop in the usual way.

In addition to its computed colour, shape, and opacity, the group as a
whole may have several further attributes:

- All of the input variables that affect the compositing computation for
  individual objects may also be applied when compositing the group with
  its backdrop. These variables include mask and constant shape, mask
  and constant opacity, and blend mode.

- The group may be *isolated* or *non-isolated*, which shall determine
  the initial backdrop against which its stack is composited.

- The group may be *knockout* or *non-knockout*, which shall determine
  whether the objects within its stack are composited with one another
  or only with the group's backdrop.

- An isolated group may specify its own blending colour space,
  independent of that of the group's backdrop.

- Instead of being composited onto the current page, a group's results
  may be used as a source of shape or opacity values for creating a
  *soft mask* (see "Soft Masks").

**11.4.2 Notation for Group Compositing Computations**

This sub-clause introduces some notation for dealing with group
compositing. Subsequent sub-clauses describe the group compositing
formulas for a non-isolated, non-knockout group and the special
properties of isolated and knockout groups.

Since we are now dealing with multiple objects at a time, it is useful
to have some notation for distinguishing among them. Accordingly, the
variables introduced earlier are altered to include a second-level
subscript denoting an object's position in the transparency stack.

Cs~i~ stands for the source colour of the *i*th object in the stack. The
subscript 0 represents the initial backdrop; subscripts 1 to *n* denote
the bottommost to topmost objects in an n-element stack. In addition,
the subscripts *b* and *r* are dropped from the variables *C~b~* ,
*f*~β~ , *q*~β~ , α~β~ , *C~r~* , *f*~ρ~ , *q*~ρ~ , and α~ρ~ ; other
variables retain their mnemonic subscripts.

These conventions permit the compositing formulas to be restated as
recurrence relations among the elements of a stack. For instance, the
result of the colour compositing computation for object *i* is denoted
by *C~i~* (formerly *C~r~* ). This computation takes as one of its
inputs the immediate backdrop colour, which is the result of the colour
compositing computation for object *i* − 1; this is denoted by
*C~i\ ~*~−\ 1~ (formerly *C~b~* ).

The revised formulas for a simple *n*-element stack (not including any
groups) shall be, for *i* = 1, ... , *n*:

> fs~i~ = fji × fmi × fki
>
> qs~i~ = qji × qmi × qki
>
> αsi = fsi × qsi
>
> α~i~ = Union(αi -- 1, αsi )
>
> fi = Union f( ~i\ --\ 1~, f~si~ ) α q~i~ = \-\-\--fi-~i~
>
> ⎛ αs

C~i~ = i ⎞ C αs

Csi + αi -- 1 × Bi (Ci -- 1, Csi )\]

where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 140.

Basic Compositing Computations.\"

**11.4.3 Group Structure and Nomenclature**

As stated earlier, the elements of a group shall be treated as a
separate transparency stack, referred to as the group stack. These
objects shall be composited against a selected initial backdrop and the
resulting colour, shape, and opacity shall then be treated as if they
belonged to a single object. The resulting object is in turn composited
with the group's backdrop in the usual way.

NOTE This computation entails interpreting the stack as a tree. For an
*n*-element group that begins at position *i* in the stack, it treats
the next *n* objects as an *n*-element substack, whose elements are
given an independent numbering of 1 to *n*. These objects are then
removed from the object numbering in the parent (containing) stack and
replaced by the group object, numbered *i*, followed by the remaining
objects to be painted on top of the group, renumbered starting at
*i* + 1. This operation applies recursively to any nested subgroups.

The term *element* (denoted *E~i~* ) refers to a member of some group;
it can be either an individual object or a contained subgroup.

From the perspective of a particular element in a nested group, there
are three different backdrops of interest:

- *The group backdrop* is the result of compositing all elements up to
  but not including the first element in the group. (This definition is
  altered if the parent group is a knockout group; see 11.4.6,
  \"Knockout Groups\")

- *The initial backdrop* is a backdrop that is selected for compositing
  the group's first element. This is either the same as the group
  backdrop (for a non-isolated group) or a fully transparent backdrop
  (for an isolated group).

- *The immediate backdrop* is the result of compositing all elements in
  the group up to but not including the current element.

When all elements in a group have been composited, the result shall be
treated as if the group were a single object, which shall then be
composited with the group backdrop. This operation shall occur whether
the initial backdrop chosen for compositing the elements of the group
was the group backdrop or a transparent backdrop. A conforming reader
shall ensure that the backdrop's contribution to the overall result is
applied only once.

**11.4.4 Group Compositing Computations**

The colour and opacity of a group shall be defined by the *group
compositing function*:

〈C f, , α〉 = Composite C( ~0~, α~0~, G )

where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 141.

+--------------+----------------------------------+
| > α~0~       | Alpha of the group's backdrop    |

|              | object alpha when the group is   |
|              | treated as an object             |
+--------------+----------------------------------+

NOTE 1 The opacity is not given explicitly as an argument or result of
this function. Almost all of the computations use the product of shape
and opacity (alpha) rather than opacity alone; therefore, it is usually
convenient to work directly with shape and alpha rather than shape and
opacity. When needed, the opacity can be computed by dividing the alpha
by the associated shape.

The result of applying the group compositing function shall then be
treated as if it were a single object, which in turn is composited with
the group's backdrop according to the formulas defined in this
sub-clause. In those formulas, the colour, shape, and alpha *(C*, *f*,
and α*)* calculated by the group compositing function shall be used,
respectively, as the source colour *C*~s~ , the object shape *f~j~* ,
and the object alpha α*~j~* .

The group compositing formulas for a non-isolated, non-knockout group
are defined as follows:

- Initialization:

> fg0 = αg0 = 0.0

- For each group element *E~i~* ∈ *G* *(i* = 1, ... , *n)*:

where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 142 (in addition to
those in Table 141).

For an element *E~i~* that is an elementary object, the colour, shape,
and alpha values C~si~, f~ji~, and αj~i~ are intrinsic attributes of the
object. For an element that is a group, the group compositing function
shall be applied recursively to the subgroup and the resulting *C*, *f*,
and α values shall be used for its C~si~, f~ji~, and αj~i~ in the
calculations for the parent group.

| NOTE 2         | The elements of a group are composited onto a backdrop that includes the      |

|                | colours being blended. This feature is what distinguishes non-isolated groups |

|                | For shape and alpha, backdrop removal is accomplished by maintaining two sets |

|                | compute the corresponding complete shape, *f~i~* , that includes the backdrop |
|                | contribution.                                                                 |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The group shape and alpha, f~gi~ and αg~i~, shall accumulate only the
shape and alpha of the group elements, excluding the group backdrop.
Their final values shall become the group results returned by the group
compositing function. The complete alpha, α*~i~* , includes the backdrop
contribution as well; its value is used in the colour compositing
computations.

NOTE 5 As a result of these corrections, the effect of compositing
objects as a group is the same as that of compositing them separately
(without grouping) if the following conditions hold:

> The group is non-isolated and has the same knockout attribute as its
> parent group (see 11.4.5, \"Isolated Groups,\" and "Knockout Groups").
>
> When compositing the group's results with the group backdrop, the
> **Normal** blend mode is used, and the shape and opacity inputs are
> always 1.0.

**11.4.5 Isolated Groups**

An *isolated group* is one whose elements shall be composited onto a
fully transparent initial backdrop rather than onto the group's
backdrop. The resulting source colour, object shape, and object alpha
for the group shall be therefore independent of the group backdrop. The
only interaction with the group backdrop shall occur when the group's
computed colour, shape, and alpha are composited with it.

In particular, the special effects produced by the blend modes of
objects within the group take into account only the intrinsic colours
and opacities of those objects; they shall not be influenced by the
group's backdrop.

EXAMPLE Applying the **Multiply** blend mode to an object in the group
produces a darkening effect on other objects lower in the group's stack
but not on the group's backdrop.

> Figure L.17 in Annex L illustrates this effect for a group consisting
> of four overlapping circles in a light gray colour (*C* = *M* = *Y* =
> 0.0; *K* = 0.15). The circles are painted within the group with
> opacity 1.0 in the **Multiply** blend mode; the group itself is
> painted against its backdrop in **Normal** blend mode. In the top row,
> the group is isolated and thus does not interact with the rainbow
> backdrop. In the bottom row, the group is non-isolated and composites
> with the backdrop. The figure also illustrates the difference between
> knockout and non-knockout groups (see "Knockout Groups").

NOTE 1 Conceptually, the effect of an isolated group could be
represented by a simple object that directly specifies a colour, shape,
and opacity at each point. This *flattening* of an isolated group is
sometimes useful for importing and exporting fully composited artwork in
applications. Furthermore, a group that specifies an explicit blending
colour space shall be an isolated group.

For an isolated group, the group compositing formulas shall be altered
by adding one statement to the initialization:

α~0~ = 0.0 if the group is isolated

That is, the initial backdrop on which the elements of the group are
composited shall be transparent rather than inherited from the group's
backdrop.

NOTE 2 This substitution also makes *C*~0~ undefined, but the normal
compositing formulas take care of that. Also, the result computation for
*C* automatically simplifies to *C* = *C~n\ ~*, since there is no
backdrop contribution to be factored out.

**11.4.6 Knockout Groups**

In a knockout group, each individual element shall be composited with
the group's initial backdrop rather than with the stack of preceding
elements in the group. When objects have binary shapes (1.0 for inside,
0.0 for outside), each object shall overwrite (knocks out) the effects
of any earlier elements it overlaps within the same group. At any given
point, only the topmost object enclosing the point shall contribute to
the result colour and opacity of the group as a whole.

EXAMPLE Figure L.17 in Annex L about 11.4.5, \"Isolated Groups,\"
illustrates the difference between knockout and non-knockout groups. In
the left column, the four overlapping circles are defined as a knockout
group and therefore do not composite with each other within the group.
In the right column, the circles form a nonknockout group and thus do
composite with each other. In each column, the upper and lower figures
depict an isolated and a non-isolated group, respectively.

NOTE 1 This model is similar to the opaque imaging model, except that
the "topmost object wins" rule applies to both the colour and the
opacity. Knockout groups are useful in composing a piece of artwork from
a collection of overlapping objects, where the topmost object in any
overlap completely obscures those beneath. At the same time, the topmost
object interacts with the group's initial backdrop in the usual way,
with its opacity and blend mode applied as appropriate.

The concept of knockout is generalized to accommodate fractional shape
values. In that case, the immediate backdrop shall be only partially
knocked out and shall be replaced by only a fraction of the result of
compositing the object with the initial backdrop.

The restated group compositing formulas deal with knockout groups by
introducing a new variable, *b*, which is a subscript that specifies
which previous result to use as the backdrop in the compositing
computations: 0 in a knockout group or *i* − 1 in a non-knockout group.
When *b* = *i* − 1, the formulas simplify to the ones given in

11.4.4, \"Group Compositing Computations.\"

In the general case, the computation shall proceed in two stages:

a)  Composite the source object with the group's initial backdrop,
    disregarding the object's shape and using a source shape value of
    1.0 everywhere. This produces unnormalized temporary alpha and
    colour results, α*t* and *C~t~* .

NOTE 2 For colour, this computation is essentially the same as the
unsimplified colour compositing formula given in

> 11.3.6, \"Interpretation of Alpha,\" but using a source shape of 1.0.
>
> α~t~ = Union(αgb, qsi )
>
> C~t~ = (1 -- qsi) × αb × Cb + qsi × ((1 -- αb) × Csi + αb × Bi (Cb,
> Csi))

b)  Compute a weighted average of this result with the object's
    immediate backdrop, using the source shape as the weighting factor.
    Then normalize the result colour by the result alpha:

> αgi = (1 -- fsi ) × αgi -- 1 + fsi × αt α~i~ = Union(α0,αgi )
>
> (1 -- fs ) × α

C~i~ =
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--i
i -- 1 × Ci -- 1 + fsi × Ct

### α~i~

This averaging computation shall be performed for both colour and alpha.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | The preceding formulas show this averaging directly. The  |
| 3    | formulas in 11.4.8, \"Summary of Group Compositing        |
|      | Computations,\" are slightly altered to use source shape  |
|      | and alpha rather than source shape and opacity, avoiding  |
|      | the need to compute a source opacity value explicitly.    |
+:=====+:==========================================================+
| NOTE | > *C~t~* in Group Compositing Computations is slightly    |
| 4    | > different from the preceding *C~t~*: it is              |
|      | > premultiplied by ^f^~si~.                               |
| NOTE |                                                           |
| 5    | The extreme values of the source shape produce the        |
|      | straightforward knockout effect. That is, a shape value   |
|      | of 1.0 (inside) yields the colour and opacity that result |
|      | from compositing the object with the initial backdrop. A  |
|      | shape value of 0.0 (outside) leaves the previous group    |
|      | results unchanged.                                        |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

The existence of the knockout feature is the main reason for maintaining
a separate shape value rather than only a single alpha that combines
shape and opacity. The separate shape value shall be computed in any
group that is subsequently used as an element of a knockout group.

A knockout group may be isolated or non-isolated; that is, *isolated*
and *knockout* are independent attributes. A non-isolated knockout group
composites its topmost enclosing element with the group's backdrop. An
isolated knockout group composites the element with a transparent
backdrop.

NOTE 6 When a non-isolated group is nested within a knockout group, the
initial backdrop of the inner group is the same as that of the outer
group; it is not the immediate backdrop of the inner group. This
behaviour, although perhaps unexpected, is a consequence of the group
compositing formulas when b = 0.

**11.4.7 Page Group**

All of the elements painted directly onto a page---both top-level groups
and top-level objects that are not part of any group---shall be treated
as if they were contained in a transparency group *P*, which in turn is
composited with a context-dependent backdrop. This group is called the
*page group*.

The page group shall be treated in one of two distinctly different ways:

- Ordinarily, the page shall be imposed directly on an output medium,
  such as paper or a display screen. The page group shall be treated as
  an isolated group, whose results shall then be composited with a
  backdrop colour appropriate for the medium. The backdrop is nominally
  white, although varying according to the actual properties of the
  medium. However, some conforming readers may choose to provide a
  different backdrop, such as a checker board or grid to aid in
  visualizing the effects of transparency in the artwork.

- A "page" of a PDF file may be treated as a graphics object to be used
  as an element of a page of some other document.

EXAMPLE This case arises, for example, when placing a PDF file
containing a piece of artwork produced by a drawing program into a page
layout produced by a layout program. In this situation, the PDF "page"
is not composited with the media colour; instead, it is treated as an
ordinary transparency group, which can be either isolated or
non-isolated and is composited with its backdrop in the normal way.

The remainder of this sub-clause pertains only to the first use of the
page group, where it is to be imposed directly on the medium.

The colour *C* of the page at a given point shall be defined by a
simplification of the general group compositing formula:

> 〈C~g~, f~g~,α~g~ 〉 = Composite U( ^·^ , 0, P )
>
> C = (1 -- α~g~) × W + α~g~ × ^C^~g~

where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 143. The first
formula computes the colour and alpha for the group given a transparent
backdrop---in effect, treating *P* as an isolated group. The second
formula composites the results with the context-dependent backdrop
(using the equivalent of the **Normal** blend mode).

|              | the medium or the needs of the   |
|              | application)                     |

|              | not used, since the α0 argument  |
|              | of Composite is 0)               |
+--------------+----------------------------------+

If not otherwise specified, the page group's colour space shall be
inherited from the native colour space of the output device---that is, a
device colour space, such as **DeviceRGB** or **DeviceCMYK**. An
explicit colour space should be specified, particularly a CIE-based
space, to ensure more predictable results of the compositing
computations within the page group. In this case, all page-level
compositing shall be done in the specified colour space, and the entire
result shall then be converted to the native colour space of the output
device before being composited with the context-dependent backdrop.

NOTE This case also arises when the page is not actually being rendered
but is converted to a flattened representation in an opaque imaging
model, such as PostScript.

NOTE Once again, keep in mind that these formulas are in their most
general form. They can be significantly simplified when some sources of
shape and opacity are not present or when shape and opacity need not be
maintained separately. Furthermore, in each specific type of group
(isolated or not, knockout or not), some terms of these formulas cancel
or drop out. An efficient implementation should use the simplified
derived formulas.

#### 11.5 Soft Masks

**11.5.1 General**

As stated in earlier sub-clauses, the shape and opacity values used in
compositing an object may include components called the mask shape
*(f~m~)* and mask opacity *(q~m~)*, which may be supplied in a PDF file
from a source independent of the object. Such an independent source,
called a *soft mask*, defines values that may vary across different
points on the page.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 The word *soft* emphasizes that the mask value at a given
         point is not limited to just 0.0 or 1.0 but can take on
         intermediate fractional values as well. Such a mask is
         typically the only means of providing position-dependent
         opacity values, since elementary objects do not have
         intrinsic opacity of their own.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 A mask used as a source of shape values is also called a
         *soft clip*, by analogy with the "hard" clipping path of
         the opaque imaging model (see Section 8.5.4). The soft clip
         is a generalization of the hard clip: a hard clip can be
         represented as a soft clip having shape values of 1.0
         inside and 0.0 outside the clipping path. Everywhere inside
         a hard clipping path, the source object's colour replaces
         the backdrop; everywhere outside, the backdrop shows
         through unchanged. With a soft clip, by contrast, a gradual
         transition can be created between an object and its
         backdrop, as in a vignette.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

A mask may be defined by creating a transparency group and painting
objects into it, thereby defining colour, shape, and opacity in the
usual way. The resulting group may then be used to derive the mask in
either of two ways, as described in the following sub-clauses.

**11.5.2 Deriving a Soft Mask from Group Alpha**

In the first method of defining a soft mask, the colour, shape, and
opacity of a transparency group *G* shall be first computed by the usual
formula

〈C f, , α〉 = Composite C( ~0~,α~0~, G )

where *C*~0~ and α~0~ represent an arbitrary backdrop whose value does
not contribute to the eventual result. The *C*, *f*, and α results shall
be the group's colour, shape, and alpha, respectively, with the backdrop
factored out.

The mask value at each point shall then be derived from the alpha of the
group. The alpha value shall be passed through a separately specified
transfer function, allowing the masking effect to be customized.

NOTE Since the group's colour is not used in this case, there is no need
to compute it.

**11.5.3 Deriving a Soft Mask from Group Luminosity**

The second method of deriving a soft mask from a transparency group
shall begin by compositing the group with a fully opaque backdrop of a
specified colour. The mask value at any given point shall then be
defined to be the luminosity of the resulting colour.

NOTE 1 This allows the mask to be derived from the shape and colour of
an arbitrary piece of artwork drawn with ordinary painting operators.

The colour *C* used to create the mask from a group *G* shall be defined
by

〈C~g~, f~g~,α~g~ 〉 = Composite C( ^·^~0~, 1, G )

> C = (1 -- αg) × C0 + αg × Cg

where *C*~0~ is the selected backdrop colour.

*G* may be any kind of group---isolated or not, knockout or
not---producing various effects on the *C* result in each case. The
colour *C* shall then be converted to luminosity in one of the following
ways, depending on the group's colour space:

- For CIE-based spaces, convert to the CIE 1931 *XYZ* space and use the
  *Y* component as the luminosity. This produces a colourimetrically
  correct luminosity.

NOTE 2 In the case of a PDF **CalRGB** space, the formula is

Y.  = Y~A~ × AGR + Y~B~ × BGG + Y~C~ × CG

> using components of the **Gamma** and **Matrix** entries of the colour
> space dictionary (see Table 64 in "CIEBased Colour Spaces"). An
> analogous computation applies to other CIE-based colour spaces.

- For device colour spaces, convert the colour to **DeviceGray** by
  implementation-defined means and use the resulting gray value as the
  luminosity, with no compensation for gamma or other colour
  calibration.

NOTE 3 This method makes no pretence of colourimetric correctness; it
merely provides a numerically simple means to produce continuous-tone
mask values. The following are formulas for converting from
**DeviceRGB** and **DeviceCMYK**, respectively:

Y.  = 0.30 × R + 0.59 × G + 0.11 × B

> Y = 0.30 × (1 -- C) × (1 -- K)
>
> \+ 0.59 × (1 -- M) × (1 -- K)
>
> \+ 0.11 × (1 -- Y) × (1 -- K)

Following this conversion, the result shall be passed through a
separately specified transfer function, allowing the masking effect to
be customized.

NOTE 4 The backdrop colour most likely to be useful is black, which
causes any areas outside the group's shape to have zero luminosity
values in the resulting mask. If the contents of the group are viewed as
a positive mask, this produces the results that would be expected with
respect to points outside the shape.

#### 11.6 Specifying Transparency in PDF

**11.6.1 General**

The preceding sub-clauses have presented the transparent imaging model
at an abstract level, with little mention of its representation in PDF.
This sub-clause describes the facilities available for specifying
transparency in PDF.

**11.6.2 Specifying Source and Backdrop Colours**

Single graphics objects, as defined in "Graphics Objects", shall be
treated as elementary objects for transparency compositing purposes
(subject to special treatment for text objects, as described in "Text
Knockout"). That is, all of a given object shall be considered to be one
element of a transparency stack. Portions of an object shall not be
composited with one another, even if they are described in a way that
would seem to cause overlaps (such as a self-intersecting path, combined
fill and stroke of a path, or a shading pattern containing an overlap or
fold-over). An object's source colour *C~s~* , used in the colour
compositing formula, shall be specified in the same way as in the opaque
imaging model: by means of the current colour in the graphics state or
the source samples in an image. The backdrop colour *C~b~* shall be the
result of previous painting operations.

**11.6.3 Specifying Blending Colour Space and Blend Mode**

The blending colour space shall be an attribute of the transparency
group within which an object is painted; its specification is described
in 11.6.6, \"Transparency Group XObjects.\" The page as a whole shall
also be treated as a group, the *page group* (see "Page Group"), with a
colour space attribute of its own. If not otherwise specified, the page
group's colour space shall be inherited from the native colour space of
the output device.

The blend mode *B* (*C~b~* , *C~s~* ) shall be determined by the
*current blend mode* parameter in the graphics state (see

"Graphics State"), which is specified by the **BM** entry in a graphics
state parameter dictionary ("Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries").
Its value shall be either a name object, designating one of the standard
blend modes listed in Tables 136 and 137 in 11.3.5, \"Blend Mode,\" or
an array of such names. In the latter case, the application shall use
the first blend mode in the array that it recognizes (or **Normal** if
it recognizes none of them).

NOTE New blend modes may be introduced in the future, and conforming
readers that do not recognize them should have reasonable fallback
behavior.

The current blend mode shall always apply to process colour components;
but only sometimes may apply to spot colorants, see 11.7.4.2, \"Blend
Modes and Overprinting,\" for details.

**11.6.4 Specifying Shape and Opacity**

> **11.6.4.1 General**

As discussed under 11.3.7.2, \"Source Shape and Opacity,\" the shape
*(f)* and opacity *(q)* values used in the compositing computation shall
come from one or more of the following sources:

- The intrinsic shape *(f~j~ )* and opacity *(q~j~ )* of the object
  being composited

- A separate shape *(f~m~ )* or opacity *(q~m~ )* mask independent of
  the object itself

- A scalar shape *(f~k~ )* or opacity *(q~k~ )* constant to be added at
  every point

The following sub-clauses describe how each of these shape and opacity
sources shall be specified in PDF.

> **11.6.4.2 Object Shape and Opacity**

The shape value *f~j~* of an object painted with PDF painting operators
shall be defined as follows:

- For objects defined by a path or a glyph and painted in a uniform
  colour with a path-painting or textshowing operator ("Path-Painting
  Operators", and "Text-Showing Operators"), the shape shall always be
  1.0 inside and 0.0 outside the path.

- For images ("Images"), the shape shall be 1.0 inside the image
  rectangle and 0.0 outside it. This may be further modified by an
  explicit or colour key mask ("Explicit Masking" and "Colour Key
  Masking").

- For image masks ("Stencil Masking"), the shape shall be 1.0 for
  painted areas and 0.0 for masked areas.

- For objects painted with a tiling pattern ("Tiling Patterns") or a
  shading pattern ("Shading Patterns"), the shape shall be further
  constrained by the objects that define the pattern (see "Patterns and
  Transparency").

- For objects painted with the **sh** operator ("Shading Operator"), the
  shape shall be 1.0 inside and 0.0 outside the bounds of the shading's
  painting geometry, disregarding the **Background** entry in the
  shading dictionary (see "Shading Dictionaries").

All elementary objects shall have an intrinsic opacity *q~j~* of 1.0
everywhere. Any desired opacity less than 1.0 shall be applied by means
of an opacity mask or constant, as described in the following
sub-clauses.

> **11.6.4.3 Mask Shape and Opacity**

At most one mask input---called a *soft mask*, or *alpha mask*---shall
be provided to any PDF compositing operation. The mask may serve as a
source of either shape *(f~m~* *)* or opacity *(q~m~* *)* values,
depending on the setting of the *alpha source* parameter in the graphics
state (see "Graphics State"). This is a boolean flag, set with the
**AIS** ("alpha is shape") entry in a graphics state parameter
dictionary ("Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries"): **true** if the
soft mask contains shape values, **false** for opacity.

The soft mask shall be specified in one of the following ways:

- The *current soft mask* parameter in the graphics state, set with the
  **SMask** entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary, contains a
  *soft-mask dictionary* (see "Soft-Mask Dictionaries") defining the
  contents of the mask. The name **None** may be specified in place of a
  soft-mask dictionary, denoting the absence of a soft mask. In this
  case, the mask shape or opacity shall be implicitly 1.0 everywhere.

- An image XObject may contain its own *soft-mask image* in the form of
  a subsidiary image XObject in the **SMask** entry of the image
  dictionary (see "Image Dictionaries"). This mask, if present, shall
  override any explicit or colour key mask specified by the image
  dictionary's **Mask** entry. Either form of mask in the image
  dictionary shall override the current soft mask in the graphics state.

- An image XObject that has a **JPXDecode** filter as its data source
  may specify an **SMaskInData** entry, indicating that the soft mask is
  embedded in the data stream (see "JPXDecode Filter").

NOTE The current soft mask in the graphics state is intended to be used
to clip only a single object at a time (either an elementary object or a
transparency group). If a soft mask is applied when painting two or more
overlapping objects, the effect of the mask multiplies with itself in
the area of overlap (except in a knockout group), producing a result
shape or opacity that is probably not what is intended. To apply a soft
mask to multiple objects, it is usually best to define the objects as a
transparency group and apply the mask to the group as a whole. These
considerations also apply to the current alpha constant (see the next
sub-clause).

> **11.6.4.4 Constant Shape and Opacity**

The *current alpha constant* parameter in the graphics state (see
"Graphics State") shall be two scalar values---one for strokes and one
for all other painting operations---to be used for the constant shape
*(f~k~)* or constant opacity *(q~k~)* component in the colour
compositing formulas.

NOTE 1 This parameter is analogous to the current colour used when
painting elementary objects.

The nonstroking alpha constant shall also be applied when painting a
transparency group's results onto its backdrop.

The stroking and nonstroking alpha constants shall be set, respectively,
by the **CA** and **ca** entries in a graphics state parameter
dictionary (see "Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries"). As described
previously for the soft mask, the alpha source flag in the graphics
state shall determine whether the alpha constants are interpreted as
shape values *(***true***)* or opacity values (**false**).

NOTE 2 The note at the end of 11.6.4.3, \"Mask Shape and Opacity,\"
applies to the current alpha constant parameter as well as the current
soft mask.

**11.6.5 Specifying Soft Masks**

> **11.6.5.1 General**

As noted under 11.6.4.3, \"Mask Shape and Opacity,\" soft masks for use
in compositing computations may be specified in one of the following
ways:

- As a soft-mask dictionary in the current soft mask parameter of the
  graphics state; see 11.6.5.2, \"SoftMask Dictionaries,\" for more
  details.

- As a soft-mask image associated with a sampled image; see 11.6.5.3,
  \"Soft-Mask Images,\" for more details.

- (*PDF 1.5*) as a mask channel embedded in JPEG2000 encoded data; see
  "JPXDecode Filter", and the **SMaskInData** entry of Table 89 for more
  details.

> **11.6.5.2 Soft-Mask Dictionaries**

The most common way of defining a soft mask is with a *soft-mask
dictionary* specified as the current soft mask in the graphics state
(see "Graphics State"). Table 144 shows the contents of this type of
dictionary.

The mask values shall be derived from those of a transparency group,
using one of the two methods described in 11.5.2, \"Deriving a Soft Mask
from Group Alpha,\" and 11.5.3, \"Deriving a Soft Mask from Group
Luminosity.\" The group shall be defined by a transparency group XObject
(see "Transparency Group XObjects") designated by the **G** entry in the
soft-mask dictionary. The **S** (subtype) entry shall specify which of
the two derivation methods to use:

- If the subtype is **Alpha**, the transparency group XObject **G**
  shall be evaluated to compute a group alpha only. The colours of the
  constituent objects shall be ignored and the colour compositing
  computations shall not be performed. The transfer function **TR**
  shall then be applied to the computed group alpha to produce the mask
  values. Outside the bounding box of the transparency group, the mask
  value shall be the result of applying the transfer function to the
  input value 0.0.

- If the subtype is **Luminosity**, the transparency group XObject **G**
  shall be composited with a fully opaque backdrop whose colour is
  everywhere defined by the soft-mask dictionary's **BC** entry. The
  computed result colour shall then be converted to a single-component
  luminosity value, and the transfer function **TR** shall be applied to
  this luminosity to produce the mask values. Outside the transparency
  group's bounding box, the mask value shall be derived by transforming
  the **BC** colour to luminosity and applying the transfer function to
  the result.

The mask's coordinate system shall be defined by concatenating the
transformation matrix specified by the **Matrix** entry in the
transparency group's form dictionary (see "Form Dictionaries") with the
current transformation matrix at the moment the soft mask is established
in the graphics state with the **gs** operator.

In a transparency group XObject that defines a soft mask, spot colour
components shall never be available, even if they are available in the
group or page on which the soft mask is used. If the group XObject's
content stream specifies a ***Separation*** or ***DeviceN*** colour
space that uses spot colour components, the alternate colour space shall
be substituted (see "Separation Colour Spaces" and "DeviceN Colour
Spaces").

> **11.6.5.3 Soft-Mask Images**

The second way to define a soft mask is by associating a *soft-mask
image* with an image XObject. This is a subsidiary image XObject
specified in the **SMask** entry of the parent XObject's image
dictionary (see "Image Dictionaries"). Entries in the subsidiary image
dictionary for such a soft-mask image shall have the same format and
meaning as in that of an ordinary image XObject (as described in Table
89 in "Image Dictionaries"), subject to the restrictions listed in Table
145. This type of image dictionary may contain an additional entry,
**Matte**.

When an image is accompanied by a soft-mask image, it is sometimes
advantageous for the image data to be *preblended* with some background
colour, called the *matte colour*. Each image sample represents a
weighted average of the original source colour and the matte colour,
using the corresponding mask sample as the weighting factor. (This is a
generalization of a technique commonly called *premultiplied alpha*.)

If the image data is preblended, the matte colour shall be specified by
a **Matte** entry in the soft-mask image dictionary (see Table 145). The
preblending computation, performed independently for each component,
shall be

> c\' = m + α× (c -- m)

where *c*′ is the value to be provided in the image source data *c* is
the original image component value *m* is the matte colour component
value α is the corresponding mask sample

This computation shall use actual colour component values, with the
effects of the ***Filter*** and ***Decode*** transformations already
performed. The computation shall be the same whether the colour space is
additive or subtractive.

                         same as the **Width** value of
                         the parent image; otherwise
                         independent of it. Both images
                         shall be mapped to the unit
                         square in user space (as are all
                         images), regardless of whether
                         the samples coincide

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**     **Type**   **Value**
  ----------- ---------- --------------------------------------------
  **Matte**   array      *(Optional; PDF 1.4)* An array of component
                         values specifying the matte colour with
                         which the image data in the parent image
                         shall have been preblended. The array shall
                         consist of *n* numbers, where *n* is the
                         number of components in the colour space
                         specified by the **ColorSpace** entry in the
                         parent image's image dictionary; the numbers
                         shall be valid colour components in that
                         colour space. If this entry is absent, the
                         image data shall not be preblended.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

When preblended image data is used in transparency blending and
compositing computations, the results shall be the same as if the
original, unblended image data were used and no matte colour were
specified. In particular, the inputs to the blend function shall be the
original colour values. To derive *c* from *c*′, the conforming reader
may sometimes need to invert the formula shown previously. The resulting
*c* value shall lie within the range of colour component values for the
image colour space.

The preblending computation shall be done in the colour space specified
by the parent image's **ColorSpace** entry. This is independent of the
group colour space into which the image may be painted. If a colour
conversion is required, inversion of the preblending shall precede the
colour conversion. If the image colour space is an **Indexed** space
(see "Indexed Colour Spaces"), the colour values in the colour table
(not the index values themselves) shall be preblended.

**11.6.6 Transparency Group XObjects**

A transparency group is represented in PDF as a special type of group
XObject (see "Group XObjects") called a *transparency group XObject*. A
group XObject is in turn a type of form XObject, distinguished by the
presence of a **Group** entry in its form dictionary (see "Form
Dictionaries"). The value of this entry is a subsidiary *group
attributes dictionary* defining the properties of the group. The format
and meaning of the dictionary's contents shall be determined by its
*group subtype*, which is specified by the dictionary's **S** entry. The
entries for a transparency group (subtype **Transparency**) are shown in
Table 147.

A page object (see "Page Objects") may also have a ***Group*** entry,
whose value is a group attributes dictionary specifying the attributes
of the page group (see "Page Group"). Some of the dictionary entries are
interpreted slightly differently for a page group than for a
transparency group XObject; see their descriptions in the table for
details.

|         |          | and the specified **I** value shall be |
|         |          | ignored. But if the page is in turn    |
|         |          | used as an element of some other page, |
|         |          | it shall be treated as if it were a    |
|         |          | transparency group XObject; the **I**  |
|         |          | value shall be interpreted in the      |
|         |          | normal way to determine whether the    |
|         |          | page group is isolated.                |

  --------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**   **Value**
  --------- ---------- -----------------------------------------
  **K**     boolean    *(Optional)* A flag specifying whether
                       the transparency group is a knockout
                       group (see "Knockout Groups"). If this
                       flag is **false**, later objects within
                       the group shall be composited with
                       earlier ones with which they overlap; if
                       **true**, they shall be composited with
                       the group's initial backdrop and shall
                       overwrite ("knock out") any earlier
                       overlapping objects. Default value:
                       **false**.

  --------------------------------------------------------------

The transparency group XObject's content stream shall define the
graphics objects belonging to the group. When applied to a transparency
group XObject, the **Do** operator shall execute its content stream and
shall composite the resulting group colour, shape, and opacity into the
group's parent group or page as if they had come from an elementary
graphics object. **Do** shall perform the following actions in addition
to the normal ones for a form XObject (as described in "Form XObjects"):

- If the transparency group is non-isolated (the value of the **I**
  entry in its group attributes dictionary is **false***)*, its initial
  backdrop, within the bounding box specified by the XObject's **BBox**
  entry, shall be defined to be the accumulated colour and alpha of the
  parent group or page---that is, the result of everything that has been
  painted in the parent up to that point. However, if the parent is a
  knockout group, the initial backdrop shall be the same as that of the
  parent. If the group is isolated (**I** is **true**), its initial
  backdrop shall be defined to be transparent.

- Before execution of the transparency group XObject's content stream,
  the current blend mode in the graphics state shall be initialized to
  **Normal**, the current stroking and nonstroking alpha constants to
  1.0, and the current soft mask to **None**.

NOTE 1 The purpose of initializing these graphics state parameters at
the beginning of execution is to ensure that they are not applied twice:
once when member objects are painted into the group and again when the
group is painted into the parent group or page.

- Objects painted by operators in the transparency group XObject's
  content stream shall be composited into the group according to the
  rules described in 11.3.3, \"Basic Compositing Formula.\" The knockout
  flag (**K**) in the group attributes dictionary and the
  transparency-related parameters of the graphics state shall be
  honoured during this computation.

- If a group colour space (**CS**) is specified in the group attributes
  dictionary, all painting operators shall convert source colours to
  that colour space before compositing objects into the group, and the
  resulting colour at each point shall be interpreted in that colour
  space. If no group colour space is specified, the prevailing colour
  space shall be dynamically inherited from the parent group or page.
  (If not otherwise specified, the page group's colour space shall be
  inherited from the native colour space of the output device.)

- After execution of the transparency group XObject's content stream,
  the graphics state shall revert to its former state before the
  invocation of the ***Do*** operator (as it does for any form XObject).
  The group's shape---the union of all objects painted into the group,
  clipped by the group XObject's bounding box--- shall then be painted
  into the parent group or page, using the group's accumulated colour
  and opacity at each point.

If the ***Do*** operator is invoked more than once for a given
transparency group XObject, each invocation shall be treated as a
separate transparency group. That is, the result shall be as if the
group were independently composited with the backdrop on each
invocation.

NOTE 2 Applications that perform caching of rendered form XObjects shall
take this requirement into account.

The actions described previously shall occur only for a transparency
group XObject---a form XObject having a **Group** entry that designates
a group attributes subdictionary whose group subtype (**S**) is
**Transparency**. An ordinary form XObject---one having no **Group**
entry---shall not be subject to any grouping behaviour for transparency
purposes. That is, the graphics objects it contains shall be composited
individually, just as if they were painted directly into the parent
group or page.

**11.6.7 Patterns and Transparency**

In the transparent imaging model, the graphics objects making up the
pattern cell of a tiling pattern (see "Tiling Patterns") may include
transparent objects and transparency groups. Transparent compositing may
occur both within the pattern cell and between it and the backdrop
wherever the pattern is painted. Similarly, a shading pattern ("Shading
Patterns") composites with its backdrop as if the shading dictionary
were applied with the **sh** operator.

In both cases, the pattern definition shall be treated as if it were
implicitly enclosed in a non-isolated transparency group: a non-knockout
group for tiling patterns, a knockout group for shading patterns. The
definition shall not inherit the current values of the graphics state
parameters at the time it is evaluated; those parameters shall take
effect only when the resulting pattern is later used to paint an object.
Instead, the graphics state parameters shall be initialized as follows:

- As always for transparency groups, those parameters related to
  transparency (blend mode, soft mask, and alpha constant) shall be
  initialized to their standard default values.

- All other parameters shall be initialized to their values at the
  beginning of the content stream (such as a page or a form XObject) in
  which the pattern shall be defined as a resource. (This is the normal
  behaviour for all patterns, in both the opaque and transparent imaging
  models.)

- In the case of a shading pattern, the parameter values may be
  augmented by the contents of the **ExtGState** entry in the pattern
  dictionary (see "Shading Patterns"). Only those parameters that affect
  the **sh** operator, such as the current transformation matrix and
  rendering intent, shall be used. Parameters that affect path-painting
  operators shall not be used, since the execution of **sh** does not
  entail painting a path.

- If the shading dictionary has a **Background** entry, the pattern's
  implicit transparency group shall be filled with the specified
  background colour before the **sh** operator is invoked.

When the pattern is later used to paint a graphics object, the colour,
shape, and opacity values resulting from the evaluation of the pattern
definition shall be used as the object's source colour *(C~s~ )*, object
shape *(f~j~ )*, and object opacity *(q~j~ )* in the transparency
compositing formulas. This painting operation is subject to the values
of the graphics state parameters in effect at the time, just as in
painting an object with a constant colour.

NOTE 1 Unlike the opaque imaging model, in which the pattern cell of a
tiling pattern may be evaluated once and then replicated indefinitely to
fill the painted area, the effect in the general transparent case is as
if the pattern definition were reexecuted independently for each tile,
taking into account the colour of the backdrop at each point. However,
in the common case in which the pattern consists entirely of objects
painted with the **Normal** blend mode, this behaviour can be optimized
by treating the pattern cell as if it were an isolated group. Since in
this case the results depend only on the colour, shape, and opacity of
the pattern cell and not on those of the backdrop, the pattern cell can
be evaluated once and then replicated, just as in opaque painting.

NOTE 2 In a raster-based implementation of tiling, all tiles should be
treated as a single transparency group. This avoids artifacts due to
multiple marking of pixels along the boundaries between adjacent tiles.

The foregoing discussion applies to both coloured (**PaintType** 1) and
uncoloured (**PaintType** 2) tiling patterns. In the latter case, the
restriction that an uncoloured pattern's definition shall not specify
colours extends as well to any transparency group that the definition
may include. There are no corresponding restrictions, however, on
specifying transparency-related parameters in the graphics state.

#### 11.7 Colour Space and Rendering Issues

**11.7.1 General**

This sub-clause describes the interactions between transparency and
other aspects of colour specification and rendering in the PDF imaging
model.

**11.7.2 Colour Spaces for Transparency Groups**

As discussed in 11.6.6, \"Transparency Group XObjects,\" a transparency
group shall either have an explicitly declared colour space of its own
or inherit that of its parent group. In either case, the colours of
source objects within the group shall be converted to the group's colour
space, if necessary, and all blending and compositing computations shall
be done in that space (see "Blending Colour Space"). The resulting
colours shall then be interpreted in that colour space when the group is
subsequently composited with its backdrop.

NOTE 1 Under this arrangement, it is envisioned that all or most of a
given piece of artwork will be created in a single colour space---most
likely, the working colour space of the application generating it. The
use of multiple colour spaces typically will arise only when assembling
independently produced artwork onto a page. After all the artwork has
been placed on the page, the conversion from the group's colour space to
the page's device colour space will be done as the last step, without
any further transparency compositing. The transparent imaging model does
not require that this convention be followed, however; the reason for
adopting it is to avoid the loss of colour information and the
introduction of errors resulting from unnecessary colour space
conversions.

Only an isolated group may have an explicitly declared colour space of
its own. Non-isolated groups shall inherit their colour space from the
parent group (subject to special treatment for the page group, as
described in "Page Group").

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | This is because the use of an explicit colour space in a  |
| 2    | non-isolated group would require converting colours from  |
|      | the backdrop's colour space to that of the group in order |
|      | to perform the compositing computations. Such conversion  |
|      | may not be possible (since some colour conversions can be |
|      | performed only in one direction), and even if possible,   |
|      | it would entail an excessive number of colour             |
|      | conversions.                                              |
+:=====+:==========================================================+
| NOTE | The choice of a group colour space has significant        |
| 3    | effects on the results that are produced:                 |
|      |                                                           |
|      | As noted in 11.3.4, \"Blending Colour Space,\" the        |
|      | results of compositing in a device colour space is        |
|      | devicedependent. For the compositing computations to work |
|      | in a device-independent way, the group's colour space     |
|      | should be CIE-based.                                      |
|      |                                                           |
|      | A consequence of choosing a CIE-based group colour space  |
|      | is that only CIE-based spaces can be used to specify the  |
|      | colours of objects within the group. This is because      |
|      | conversion from device to CIE-based colours is not        |
|      | possible in general; the defined conversions work only in |
|      | the opposite direction. See further discussion            |
|      | subsequently.                                             |
|      |                                                           |
|      | The compositing computations and blend functions          |
|      | generally compute linear combinations of colour component |
|      | values, on the assumption that the component values       |
|      | themselves are linear. For this reason, it is usually     |
|      | best to choose a group colour space that has a linear     |
|      | gamma function. If a nonlinear colour space is chosen,    |
|      | the results are still well-defined, but the appearance    |
|      | may not match the user's expectations.                    |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | The CIE-based *sRGB* colour space (see "CIE-Based Colour  |
| 4    | Spaces") is nonlinear and hence may be unsuitable for use |
|      | as a group colour space.                                  |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | Implementations of the transparent imaging model should   |
| 5    | use as much precision as possible in representing colours |
|      | during compositing computations and in the accumulated    |
|      | group results. To minimize the accumulation of roundoff   |
|      | errors and avoid additional errors arising from the use   |
|      | of linear group colour spaces, more precision is needed   |
|      | for intermediate results than is typically used to        |
|      | represent either the original source data or the final    |
|      | rasterized results.                                       |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

If a group's colour space---whether specified explicitly or inherited
from the parent group---is CIE-based, any use of device colour spaces
for painting objects shall be subject to special treatment. Device
colours cannot be painted directly into such a group, since there is no
generally defined method for converting them to the CIEbased colour
space. This problem arises in the following cases:

- **DeviceGray**, **DeviceRGB**, and **DeviceCMYK** colour spaces,
  unless remapped to default CIE-based colour spaces (see "Default
  Colour Spaces")

- Operators (such as **rg**) that specify a device colour space
  implicitly, unless that space is remapped

- Special colour spaces whose base or underlying space is a device
  colour space, unless that space is remapped

The default colour space remapping mechanism should always be employed
when defining a transparency group whose colour space is CIE-based. If a
device colour is specified and is not remapped, it shall be converted to
the CIE-based colour space in an implementation-dependent fashion,
producing unpredictable results.

NOTE 6 The foregoing restrictions do not apply if the group's colour
space is implicitly converted to ***DeviceCMYK***, as discussed in
"Implicit Conversion of CIE-Based Colour Spaces".

**11.7.3 Spot Colours and Transparency**

The foregoing discussion of colour spaces has been concerned with
*process colours*---those produced by combinations of an output device's
process colorants. Process colours may be specified directly in the
device's native colour space (such as **DeviceCMYK**), or they may be
produced by conversion from some other colour space, such as a CIE-based
(**CalRGB** or **ICCBased**) space. Whatever means is used to specify
them, process colours shall be subject to conversion to and from the
group's colour space.

A *spot colour* is an additional colour component, independent of those
used to produce process colours. It may represent either an additional
separation to be produced or an additional colorant to be applied to the
composite page (see "Separation Colour Spaces" and "DeviceN Colour
Spaces"). The colour component value, or *tint*, for a spot colour
specifies the concentration of the corresponding spot colorant. Tints
are conventionally represented as subtractive, rather than additive,
values.

Spot colours are inherently device-dependent and are not always
available. In the opaque imaging model, each use of a spot colour
component in a **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space is accompanied
by an *alternate colour space* and a *tint transformation function* for
mapping tint values into that space. This enables the colour to be
approximated with process colorants when the corresponding spot colorant
is not available on the device.

Spot colours can be accommodated straightforwardly in the transparent
imaging model (except for issues relating to overprinting, discussed in
"Overprinting and Transparency"). When an object is painted
transparently with a spot colour component that is available in the
output device, that colour shall be composited with the corresponding
spot colour component of the backdrop, independently of the compositing
that is performed for process colours. A spot colour retains its own
identity; it shall not be subject to conversion to or from the colour
space of the enclosing transparency group or page. If the object is an
element of a transparency group, one of two things shall happen:

- The group shall maintain a separate colour value for each spot colour
  component, independently of the group's colour space. In effect, the
  spot colour passes directly through the group hierarchy to the device,
  with no colour conversions performed. However, it shall still be
  subject to blending and compositing with other objects that use the
  same spot colour.

- The spot colour shall be converted to its alternate colour space. The
  resulting colour shall then be subject to the usual compositing rules
  for process colours. In particular, spot colours shall not be
  available in a transparency group XObject that is used to define a
  soft mask; the alternate colour space shall always be substituted in
  that case.

Only a single shape value and opacity value shall be maintained at each
point in the computed group results; they shall apply to both process
and spot colour components. In effect, every object shall be considered
to paint every existing colour component, both process and spot. Where
no value has been explicitly specified for a given component in a given
object, an additive value of 1.0 (or a subtractive tint value of 0.0)
shall be assumed. For instance, when painting an object with a colour
specified in a **DeviceCMYK** or **ICCBased** colour space, the process
colour components shall be painted as specified and the spot colour
components shall be painted with an additive value of 1.0. Likewise,
when painting an object with a colour specified in a **Separation**
colour space, the named spot colour shall be painted as specified and
all other components (both process colours and other spot colours) shall
be painted with an additive value of 1.0. The consequences of this are
discussed in 11.7.4, \"Overprinting and Transparency.\"

Under the opaque imaging model, a **Separation** or DeviceN colour space
may specify the individual process colour components of the output
device, as if they were spot colours. However, within a transparency
group, this should be done only if the group inherits the native colour
space of the output device (or is implicitly converted to
**DeviceCMYK**, as discussed in 8.6.5.7, \"Implicit Conversion of
CIE-Based Colour Spaces\"). If any other colour space has been specified
for the group, the Separation or **DeviceN** colour space shall be
converted to its alternate colour space.

NOTE In general, within a transparency group containing an
explicitly-specified colour space, the group\'s process colour
components are different from the device\'s process colour components.
Conversion to the device\'s process colour components occurs only after
all colour compositing computations for the group have been completed.
Consequently, the device\'s process colour components are not accessible
within the group.

> For instance, outside of any transparency group, a device whose native
> colour space is **DeviceCMYK** has a **Cyan** component that may be
> specified in a **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space. On the
> other hand, within a transparency group whose colour space is
> **ICCBased**, the group has no **Cyan** component available to be
> painted.

**11.7.4 Overprinting and Transparency**

> **11.7.4.1 General**

In the opaque imaging model, overprinting is controlled by two
parameters of the graphics state: the *overprint parameter* and the
*overprint mode* (see "Overprint Control"). Painting an object causes
some specific set of device colorants to be marked, as determined by the
current colour space and current colour in the graphics state. The
remaining colorants shall be either erased or left unchanged, depending
on whether the overprint parameter is **false** or **true**. When the
current colour space is **DeviceCMYK**, the overprint mode parameter
additionally enables this selective marking of colorants to be applied
to individual colour components according to whether the component value
is zero or nonzero.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 Because this model of overprinting deals directly with the
         painting of device colorants, independently of the colour
         space in which source colours have been specified, it is
         highly device-dependent and primarily addresses production
         needs rather than design intent. Overprinting is usually
         reserved for opaque colorants or for very dark colours,
         such as black. It is also invoked during late-stage
         production operations such as trapping (see "Trapping
         Support"), when the actual set of device colorants has
         already been determined.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 Consequently, it is best to think of transparency as taking
         place in appearance space, but overprinting of device
         colorants in device space. This means that colorant
         overprint decisions should be made at output time, based on
         the actual resultant colorants of any transparency
         compositing operation. On the other hand, effects similar
         to overprinting can be achieved in a device-independent
         manner by taking advantage of blend modes, as described in
         the next sub-clause.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

> **11.7.4.2 Blend Modes and Overprinting**

As stated in 11.7.3, \"Spot Colours and Transparency,\" each graphics
object that is painted shall affect all existing colour components: all
process colorants in the transparency group's colour space as well as
any available spot colorants. For colour components whose value has not
been specified, a source colour value of 1.0 shall be assumed; when
objects are fully opaque and the **Normal** blend mode is used, this
shall have the effect of erasing those components. This treatment is
consistent with the behaviour of the opaque imaging model with the
overprint parameter set to **false**.

The transparent imaging model defines some blend modes, such as
**Darken**, that can be used to achieve effects similar to overprinting.
The blend function for **Darken** is

> B c( ~b~, c~s~ ) = min c( ~b~, c~s~ )

In this blend mode, the result of compositing shall always be the same
as the backdrop colour when the source colour is 1.0, as it is for all
unspecified colour components. When the backdrop is fully opaque, this
shall leave the result colour unchanged from that of the backdrop. This
is consistent with the behaviour of the opaque imaging model with the
overprint parameter set to **true**.

If the object or backdrop is not fully opaque, the actions described
previously are altered accordingly. That is, the erasing effect shall be
reduced, and overprinting an object with a colour value of 1.0 may
affect the result colour. While these results may or may not be useful,
they lie outside the realm of the overprinting and erasing behaviour
defined in the opaque imaging model.

When process colours are overprinted or erased (because a spot colour is
being painted), the blending computations described previously shall be
done independently for each component in the group's colour space. If
that space is different from the native colour space of the output
device, its components are not the device's actual process colorants;
the blending computations shall affect the process colorants only after
the group's results have been converted to the device colour space. Thus
the effect is different from that of overprinting or erasing the
device's process colorants directly. On the other hand, this is a fully
general operation that works uniformly, regardless of the type of object
or of the computations that produced the source colour.

NOTE 1 The discussion so far has focused on those colour components
whose values are not specified and that are to be either erased or left
unchanged. However, the **Normal** or **Darken** blend modes used for
these purposes may not be suitable for use on those components whose
colour values are specified. In particular, using the **Darken** blend
mode for such components would preclude overprinting a dark colour with
a lighter one. Moreover, some other blend mode may be specifically
desired for those components.

The PDF graphics state specifies only one current blend mode parameter,
which shall always apply to process colorants and sometimes to spot
colorants as well. Specifically, only separable, white-preserving blend
modes shall be used for spot colours. If the specified blend mode is not
separable and white-preserving, it shall apply only to process colour
components, and the **Normal** blend mode shall be substituted for spot
colours.

A blend mode is *white-preserving* if its blend function *B* has the
property that *B* (1.0, 1.0) = 1.0.

NOTE 2 Of the standard separable blend modes listed in Table 136 in
11.3.5, \"Blend Mode,\" all except **Difference** and **Exclusion** are
white-preserving. This ensures that when objects accumulate in an
isolated transparency group, the accumulated values for unspecified
components remain 1.0 as long as only white-preserving blend modes are
used. The group's results can then be overprinted using **Darken** (or
other useful modes) while avoiding unwanted interactions with components
whose values were never specified within the group.

> **11.7.4.3 Compatibility with Opaque Overprinting**

Because the use of blend modes to achieve effects similar to
overprinting does not make direct use of the overprint control
parameters in the graphics state, such methods are usable only by
transparency-aware applications. For compatibility with the methods of
overprint control used in the opaque imaging model, a special blend
mode, CompatibleOverprint, is provided that consults the
overprint-related graphics state parameters to compute its result. This
mode shall apply only when painting elementary graphics objects (fills,
strokes, text, images, and shadings). It shall not be invoked explicitly
and shall not be identified by any PDF name object; rather, it shall be
implicitly invoked whenever an elementary graphics object is painted
while overprinting is enabled (that is, when the overprint parameter in
the graphics state is **true**).

NOTE 1 Earlier designs of the transparent imaging model included an
additional blend mode named ***Compatible***, which explicitly invoked
the CompatibleOverprint blend mode described here. Because
CompatibleOverprint is now invoked implicitly whenever appropriate, it
is never necessary to specify the ***Compatible*** blend mode for use in
compositing.

The Compatible blend mode shall be treated as equivalent to
***Normal***.

The value of the blend function *B* (*c~b~* , *c~s~* ) in the
CompatibleOverprint mode shall be either *c~b~* or *c~s~* , depending on
the setting of the overprint mode parameter, the current and group
colour spaces, and the source colour value *c~s~* :

- If the overprint mode is 1 (nonzero overprint mode) and the current
  colour space and group colour space are both **DeviceCMYK**, then
  process colour components with nonzero values shall replace the
  corresponding component values of the backdrop; components with zero
  values leave the existing backdrop value unchanged. That is, the value
  of the blend function *B* (*c~b~* , *c~s~* ) shall be the source
  component *c~s~* for any process (**DeviceCMYK**) colour component
  whose (subtractive) colour value is nonzero; otherwise it shall be the
  backdrop component *c~b~* . For spot colour components, the value
  shall always be *c~b~* .

- In all other cases, the value of *B* (*c~b~* , *c~s~* ) shall be
  *c~s~* for all colour components specified in the current colour
  space, otherwise *c~b~* .

EXAMPLE 1 If the current colour space is **DeviceCMYK** or **CalRGB**,
the value of the blend function is *c~s~* for process colour components
and *c~b~* for spot components. On the other hand, if the current colour
space is a **Separation** space representing a spot colour component,
the value is *c~s~* for that spot component and *c~b\ ~*for all process
components and all other spot components.

NOTE 2 In the previous descriptions, the term *current colour space*
refers to the colour space used for a painting operation. This may be
specified by the current colour space parameter in the graphics state
(see "Colour Values"), implicitly by colour operators such as ***rg***
("Colour Operators"), or by the **ColorSpace** entry of an image XObject
("Image Dictionaries"). In the case of an ***Indexed*** space, it refers
to the base colour space (see "Indexed Colour Spaces"); likewise for
***Separation*** and ***DeviceN*** spaces that revert to their alternate
colour space, as described under "Separation Colour Spaces" and "DeviceN
Colour Spaces".

If the current blend mode when CompatibleOverprint is invoked is any
mode other than **Normal**, the object being painted shall be implicitly
treated as if it were defined in a non-isolated, non-knockout
transparency group and painted using the CompatibleOverprint blend mode.
The group's results shall then be painted using the current blend mode
in the graphics state.

NOTE 3 It is not necessary to create such an implicit transparency group
if the current blend mode is ***Normal***; simply substituting the
CompatibleOverprint blend mode while painting the object produces
equivalent results. There are some additional cases in which the
implicit transparency group can be optimized out.

EXAMPLE 2 Figure L.20 in Annex L shows the effects of all four possible
combinations of blending and overprinting, using the **Screen** blend
mode in the **DeviceCMYK** colour space. The label "overprint enabled"
means that the overprint parameter in the graphics state is **true** and
the overprint mode is 1. In the upper half of the figure, a light green
oval is painted opaquely (opacity = 1.0) over a backdrop shading from
pure yellow to pure magenta. In the lower half, the same object is
painted with transparency (opacity = 0.5).

> **11.7.4.4 Special Path-Painting Considerations**

The overprinting considerations discussed in 11.7.4.3, \"Compatibility
with Opaque Overprinting,\" also affect those path-painting operations
that combine filling and stroking a path in a single operation. These
include the **B**, **B\***, **b**, and **b\*** operators (see
"Path-Painting Operators") and the painting of glyphs with text
rendering mode 2 or 6 ("Text Rendering Mode"). For transparency
compositing purposes, the combined fill and stroke shall be treated as a
single graphics object, as if they were enclosed in a transparency
group. This implicit group is established and used as follows:

- If overprinting is enabled (the overprint parameter in the graphics
  state is **true**) and the current stroking and nonstroking alpha
  constants are equal, a non-isolated, non-knockout transparency group
  shall be established. Within the group, the fill and stroke shall be
  performed with an alpha value of 1.0 but with the CompatibleOverprint
  blend mode. The group results shall then be composited with the
  backdrop, using the originally specified alpha and blend mode.

- In all other cases, a non-isolated knockout group shall be
  established. Within the group, the fill and stroke shall be performed
  with their respective prevailing alpha constants and the prevailing
  blend mode. The group results shall then be composited with the
  backdrop, using an alpha value of 1.0 and the **Normal** blend mode.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 In the case of showing text with the combined filling and
         stroking text rendering modes, this behaviour is
         independent of the text knockout parameter in the graphics
         state (see "Text Knockout").
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 The purpose of these rules is to avoid having a non-opaque
         stroke composite with the result of the fill in the region
         of overlap, which would produce a double border effect that
         is usually undesirable. The special case that applies when
         the overprint parameter is **true** is for backward
         compatibility with the overprinting behavior of the opaque
         imaging model. If a desired effect cannot be achieved with
         a combined filling and stroking operator or text rendering
         mode, it can be achieved by specifying the fill and stroke
         with separate path objects and an explicit transparency
         group.

  NOTE 3 Overprinting of the stroke over the fill does not work in
         the second case described previously (although either the
         fill or the stroke can still overprint the backdrop).
         Furthermore, if the overprint graphics state parameter is
         **true**, the results are discontinuous at the transition
         between equal and unequal values of the stroking and
         nonstroking alpha constants. For this reason, it is best
         not to use overprinting for combined filling and stroking
         operations if the stroking and nonstroking alpha constants
         are being varied independently.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

> **11.7.4.5 Summary of Overprinting Behaviour**

Tables 148 and 149 summarize the overprinting and erasing behaviour in
the opaque and transparent imaging models, respectively. Table 148 shows
the overprinting rules used in the opaque model, as described in
"Overprint Control". Table 149 shows the equivalent rules as implemented
by the CompatibleOverprint blend mode in the transparent model. The
names **OP** and **OPM** in the tables refer to the overprint and
overprint mode parameters of the graphics state.

Colour component values are represented in these tables as subtractive
tint values because overprinting is typically applied to subtractive
colorants such as inks rather than to additive ones such as phosphors on
a display screen. The CompatibleOverprint blend mode is therefore
described as if it took subtractive arguments and returned subtractive
results. In reality, however, CompatibleOverprint (like all blend modes)
shall treat colour components as additive values; subtractive components
shall be complemented before and after application of the blend
function.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 This note describes an important difference between Table
         148 and Table 149. In Table 148, the process colour
         components being discussed are the actual device
         colorants---the colour components of the output device's
         native colour space (**DeviceGray**, **DeviceRGB**, or
         **DeviceCMYK**). In Table 149, the process colour
         components are those of the group's colour space, which is
         not necessarily the same as that of the output device (and
         can even be something like **CalRGB** or **ICCBased**). For
         this reason, the process colour components of the group
         colour space cannot be treated as if they were spot colours
         in a **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour space (see "Spot
         Colours and Transparency"). This difference between opaque
         and transparent overprinting and erasing rules arises only
         within a transparency group (including the page group, if
         its colour space is different from the native colour space
         of the output device). There is no difference in the
         treatment of spot colour components.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 Table 149 has one additional row at the bottom. It applies
         when painting an object that is a transparency group rather
         than an elementary object (fill, stroke, text, image, or
         shading). As stated in 11.7.3, \"Spot Colours and
         Transparency,\" a group is considered to paint all colour
         components, both process and spot. Colour components that
         were not explicitly painted by any object in the group have
         an additive colour value of 1.0 (subtractive tint 0.0).
         Since no information is retained about which components
         were actually painted within the group, compatible
         overprinting is not possible in this case; the
         CompatibleOverprint blend mode reverts to **Normal**, with
         no consideration of the overprint and overprint mode
         parameters. A transparency-aware conforming writer can
         choose a more suitable blend mode, such as **Darken**, to
         produce an effect similar to overprinting.

**11.7.5 Rendering Parameters and Transparency**

> **11.7.5.1 General**

The opaque imaging model has several graphics state parameters dealing
with the rendering of colour: the current halftone (see "Halftone
Dictionaries"), transfer functions ("Transfer Functions"), rendering
intent ("Rendering Intents"), and black-generation and
undercolor-removal functions ("Conversion from DeviceRGB to
DeviceCMYK"). All of these rendering parameters may be specified on a
per-object basis; they control how a particular object is rendered. When
all objects are opaque, it is easy to define what this means. But when
they are transparent, more than one object may contribute to the colour
at a given point; it is unclear which rendering parameters to apply in
an area where transparent objects overlap. At the same time, the
transparent imaging model should be consistent with the opaque model
when only opaque objects are painted.

There are two categories of rendering parameters that are treated
somewhat differently in the presence of transparency. In the first
category are halftone and transfer functions, which are applied only
when the final colour at a given point on the page is known. In the
second category are rendering intent, black generation, and undercolor
removal, which are applied whenever colours are converted from one
colour space to another.

> **11.7.5.2 Halftone and Transfer Function**

When objects are transparent, rendering of an object does not occur when
the object is specified but at some later time. Hence, the
implementation shall keep track of the halftone and transfer function
parameters at each point on the page from the time they are specified
until the time rendering actually occurs. This means that these
rendering parameters shall be associated with regions of the page rather
than with individual objects.

The halftone and transfer function to be used at any given point on the
page shall be those in effect at the time of painting the last (topmost)
elementary graphics object enclosing that point, but only if the object
is fully opaque. Only elementary objects shall be relevant; the
rendering parameters associated with a group object are ignored. The
*topmost object* at any point shall be defined to be the topmost
elementary object in the entire page stack that has a nonzero object
shape value *(f~j~ )* at that point (that is, for which the point is
inside the object). An object shall be considered to be *fully opaque*
if all of the following conditions hold at the time the object is
painted:

- The current alpha constant in the graphics state (stroking or
  nonstroking, depending on the painting operation) is 1.0.

- The current blend mode in the graphics state is **Normal** (or
  **Compatible**, which is treated as equivalent to **Normal**).

- The current soft mask in the graphics state is **None**. If the object
  is an image XObject, there is not an **SMask** entry in its image
  dictionary.

- The foregoing three conditions were also true at the time the **Do**
  operator was invoked for the group containing the object, as well as
  for any direct ancestor groups.

- If the current colour is a tiling pattern, all objects in the
  definition of its pattern cell also satisfy the foregoing conditions.

Together, these conditions ensure that only the object itself shall
contribute to the colour at the given point, completely obscuring the
backdrop. For portions of the page whose topmost object is not fully
opaque or that are never painted at all, the default halftone and
transfer function for the page shall be used.

If a graphics object is painted with overprinting enabled---that is, if
the applicable (stroking or nonstroking) overprint parameter in the
graphics state is **true**---the halftone and transfer function to use
at a given point shall be determined independently for each colour
component. Overprinting implicitly invokes the CompatibleOverprint blend
mode (see "Compatibility with Opaque Overprinting"). An object shall be
considered opaque for a given component only if CompatibleOverprint
yields the source colour (not the backdrop colour) for that component.

> **11.7.5.3 Rendering Intent and Colour Conversions**

The rendering intent, black-generation, and undercolor-removal
parameters control certain colour conversions. In the presence of
transparency, they may need to be applied earlier than the actual
rendering of colour onto the page.

The rendering intent influences the conversion from a CIE-based colour
space to a target colour space, taking into account the target space's
colour gamut (the range of colours it can reproduce). Whereas in the
opaque imaging model the target space shall always be the native colour
space of the output device, in the transparent model it may instead be
the group colour space of a transparency group into which an object is
being painted.

The rendering intent is needed at the moment such a conversion is
performed---that is, when painting an elementary or group object
specified in a CIE-based colour space into a parent group having a
different colour space.

NOTE 1 This differs from the current halftone and transfer function,
whose values are used only when all colour compositing has been
completed and rasterization is being performed.

In all cases, the rendering intent to use for converting an object's
colour (whether that of an elementary object or of a transparency group)
shall be determined by the rendering intent parameter associated with
the object. In particular:

- When painting an elementary object with a CIE-based colour into a
  transparency group having a different colour space, the rendering
  intent used shall be the current rendering intent in effect in the
  graphics state at the time of the painting operation.

- When painting a transparency group whose colour space is CIE-based
  into a parent group having a different colour space, the rendering
  intent used shall be the current rendering intent in effect at the
  time the **Do** operator is applied to the group.

- When the colour space of the page group is CIE-based, the rendering
  intent used to convert colours to the native colour space of the
  output device shall be the default rendering intent for the page.

NOTE 2 Since there may be one or more nested transparency groups having
different CIE-based colour spaces, the colour of an elementary source
object may be converted to the device colour space in multiple stages,
controlled by the rendering intent in effect at each stage. The proper
choice of rendering intent at each stage depends on the relative gamuts
of the source and target colour spaces. It is specified explicitly by
the document producer, not prescribed by the PDF specification, since no
single policy for managing rendering intents is appropriate for all
situations.

A similar approach works for the black-generation and undercolor-removal
functions, which shall be applied only during conversion from
**DeviceRGB** to **DeviceCMYK** colour spaces:

- When painting an elementary object with a **DeviceRGB** colour
  directly into a transparency group whose colour space is
  **DeviceCMYK**, the functions used shall be the current
  black-generation and undercolorremoval functions in effect in the
  graphics state at the time of the painting operation.

- When painting a transparency group whose colour space is **DeviceRGB**
  into a parent group whose colour space is **DeviceCMYK**, the
  functions used shall be the ones in effect at the time the **Do**
  operator is applied to the group.

- When the colour space of the page group is **DeviceRGB** and the
  native colour space of the output device is **DeviceCMYK**, the
  functions used to convert colours to the device's colour space shall
  be the default functions for the page.

## 12 Interactive Features

### 12.1 General

For purposes of the trigger events **E** (enter), **X** (exit), **D**
(down), and **U** (up), the term *mouse* denotes a generic pointing
device with the following characteristics:

- A selection button that can be *pressed*, *held down*, and *released*.
  If there is more than one mouse button, the selection button is
  typically the left button.

- A notion of *location*---that is, an indication of where on the screen
  the device is pointing. Location is typically denoted by a screen
  cursor.

- A notion of *focus*---that is, which element in the document is
  currently interacting with the with the user. In many systems, this
  element is denoted by a blinking caret, a focus rectangle, or a colour
  change.

This clause describes the PDF features that allow a user to interact
with a document on the screen, using the mouse and keyboard (with the
exception of multimedia features, which are described in 13, "Multimedia
Features"):

- *Preference settings* to control the way the document is presented on
  the screen (12.2, "Viewer Preferences")

- *Navigation* facilities for moving through the document in a variety
  of ways (Sections 12.3, "Document-Level Navigation" and 12.4,
  "Page-Level Navigation")

- *Annotations* for adding text notes, sounds, movies, and other
  ancillary information to the document (12.5, "Annotations")

- *Actions* that can be triggered by specified events (12.6, "Actions")

- *Interactive forms* for gathering information from the user (12.7,
  "Interactive Forms")

- *Digital signatures* that authenticate the identity of a user and the
  validity of the document's contents (12.8, "Digital Signatures")

- *Measurement properties* that enable the display of real-world units
  corresponding to objects on a page (12.9, "Measurement Properties")

### 12.2 Viewer Preferences

The **ViewerPreferences** entry in a document's catalogue (see 7.7.2,
"Document Catalog") *designates a* *viewer preferences dictionary* *(PDF
1.2)* controlling the way the document shall be presented on the screen
or in print. If no such dictionary is specified, conforming readers
should behave in accordance with their own current user preference
settings. Table 150 shows the contents of the viewer preferences
dictionary.

present the user with an interactive, global overview of a document in
either of two forms:

- As a hierarchical *outline* showing the document's internal structure

- As a collection of *thumbnail images* representing the pages of the
  document in miniature form

Each item in the outline or each thumbnail image may be associated with
a corresponding *destination* in the document, so that the user can jump
directly to the destination by clicking with the mouse.

**12.3.2 Destinations**

**12.3.2.1 General**

A *destination* defines a particular view of a document, consisting of
the following items:

- The page of the document that shall be displayed

- The location of the document window on that page

- The magnification (zoom) factor

Destinations may be associated with outline items (see 12.3.3, "Document
Outline"), annotations (12.5.6.5, "Link Annotations"), or actions
(12.6.4.2, "Go-To Actions" and 12.6.4.3, "Remote Go-To Actions"). In
each case, the destination specifies the view of the document that shall
be presented when the outline item or annotation is opened or the action
is performed. In addition, the optional **OpenAction** entry in a
document's catalogue (7.7.2, "Document Catalog") may specify a
destination that shall be displayed when the document is opened. A
destination may be specified either explicitly by an array of parameters
defining its properties or indirectly by name.

**12.3.2.2 Explicit Destinations**

Table 151 shows the allowed syntactic forms for specifying a destination
explicitly in a PDF file. In each case, *page* is an indirect reference
to a page object (except in a remote go-to action; see 12.6.4.3, "Remote
Go-To Actions"). All coordinate values (*left*, *right*, *top*, and
*bottom*) shall be expressed in the default user space coordinate
system. The page's *bounding box* is the smallest rectangle enclosing
all of its contents. (If any side of the bounding box lies outside the
page's crop box, the corresponding side of the crop box shall be used
instead; see 14.11.2, "Page Boundaries," for further discussion of the
crop box.)

No page object can be specified for a destination associated with a
remote go-to action (see 12.6.4.3, "Remote Go-To Actions") because the
destination page is in a different PDF document. In this case, the
*page* parameter specifies an integer page number within the remote
document instead of a page object in the current document.

**12.3.2.3 Named Destinations**

Instead of being defined directly with the explicit syntax shown in
Table 151, a destination may be referred to indirectly by means of a
name object *(PDF 1.1)* or a byte string *(PDF 1.2)*. This capability is
especially useful when the destination is located in another PDF
document.

NOTE 1 A link to the beginning of Chapter 6 in another document might
refer to the destination by a name, such as Chap6 . begin, instead of by
an explicit page number in the other document. Then, the location of the
chapter in the other document could change without invalidating the
link. If an annotation or outline item that refers to a named
destination has an associated action, such as a remote go-to action (see
12.6.4.3, "Remote Go-To Actions") or a thread action (12.6.4.6, "Thread
Actions"), the destination is in the file specified by the action's
**F** entry, if any; if there is no **F** entry, the destination is in
the current file.

In PDF 1.1, the correspondence between name objects and destinations
shall be defined by the **Dests** entry in the document catalogue (see
7.7.2, "Document Catalog"). The value of this entry shall be a
dictionary in which each key is a destination name and the corresponding
value is either an array defining the destination, using the syntax
shown in Table 151, or a dictionary with a **D** entry whose value is
such an array.

NOTE 2 The latter form allows additional attributes to be associated
with the destination, as well as enabling a go-to action (see 12.6.4.2,
"Go-To Actions") that shall be used as the target of a named
destination.

In PDF 1.2 and later, the correspondence between strings and
destinations may alternatively be defined by the **Dests** entry in the
document's name dictionary (see 7.7.4, "Name Dictionary"). The value of
this entry shall be a name tree (7.9.6, "Name Trees") mapping name
strings to destinations. (The keys in the name tree may be treated as
text strings for display purposes.) The destination value associated
with a key in the name tree may be either an array or a dictionary, as
described in the preceding paragraph.

NOTE 3 The use of strings as destination names is a PDF 1.2 feature. If
compatibility with earlier versions of PDF is required, only name
objects may be used to refer to named destinations. A document that
supports PDF 1.2 can contain both types. However, if backward
compatibility is not a consideration, applications should use the string
form of representation in the **Dests** name tree.

**12.3.3 Document Outline**

A PDF document may contain a *document outline* that the conforming
reader may display on the screen, allowing the user to navigate
interactively from one part of the document to another. The outline
consists of a tree-structured hierarchy of *outline items* (sometimes
called *bookmarks*), which serve as a visual table of contents to
display the document's structure to the user. The user may interactively
open and close individual items by clicking them with the mouse. When an
item is open, its immediate children in the hierarchy shall become
visible on the screen; each child may in turn be open or closed,
selectively revealing or hiding further parts of the hierarchy. When an
item is closed, all of its descendants in the hierarchy shall be hidden.
Clicking the text of any visible item *activates* the item, causing the
conforming reader to jump to a destination or trigger an action
associated with the item.

The root of a document's outline hierarchy is an *outline dictionary*
specified by the **Outlines** entry in the document catalogue (see
7.7.2, "Document Catalog"). Table 152 shows the contents of this
dictionary. Each individual outline item within the hierarchy shall be
defined by an *outline item dictionary* (Table 153). The items at each
level of the hierarchy form a linked list, chained together through
their **Prev** and **Next** entries and accessed through the **First**
and **Last** entries in the parent item (or in the outline dictionary in
the case of toplevel items). When displayed on the screen, the items at
a given level shall appear in the order in which they occur in the
linked list.

The value of the outline item dictionary's **F** entry *(PDF 1.4)* shall
be an integer interpreted as one-bit flags specifying style
characteristics for displaying the item. Bit positions within the flag
word are numbered from loworder to high-order bits, with the
lowest-order bit numbered 1. Table 154 shows the meanings of the flags;
all other bits of the integer shall be 0.

**12.3.4 Thumbnail Images**

A PDF document may contain *thumbnail images* representing the contents
of its pages in miniature form. A conforming reader may display these
images on the screen, allowing the user to navigate to a page by
clicking its thumbnail image:

NOTE Thumbnail images are not required, and may be included for some
pages and not for others.

The thumbnail image for a page shall be an image XObject specified by
the **Thumb** entry in the page object (see 7.7.3, "Page Tree"). It has
the usual structure for an image dictionary (8.9.5, "Image
Dictionaries"), but only the **Width**, **Height**, **ColorSpace**,
**BitsPerComponent**, and **Decode** entries are significant; all of the
other entries listed in Table 89 shall be ignored if present. (If a
**Subtype** entry is specified, its value shall be **Image**.) The
image's colour space shall be either **DeviceGray** or **DeviceRGB**, or
an **Indexed** space based on one of these.

EXAMPLE This example shows a typical thumbnail image definition.

**12.3.5 Collections**

Beginning with PDF 1.7, PDF documents may specify how a conforming
reader's user interface presents collections of file attachments, where
the attachments are related in structure or content. Such a presentation
is called a portable collection.

NOTE 1 The intent of portable collections is to present, sort, and
search collections of related documents embedded in the containing PDF
document, such as email archives, photo collections, and engineering bid
sets. There is no requirement that documents in a collection have an
implicit relationship or even a similarity; however, showing
differentiating characteristics of related documents can be helpful for
document navigation.

A *collection dictionary* specifies the viewing and organizational
characteristics of portable collections. If this dictionary is present
in a PDF document, the conforming reader shall present the document as a
portable collection. The **EmbeddedFiles** name tree specifies file
attachments (see 7.11.4, "Embedded File Streams").

When a conforming reader first opens a PDF document containing a
collection, it shall display the contents of the initial document, along
with a list of the documents present in the **EmbeddedFiles** name tree.
The document list shall include the additional document information
specified by the collection schema. The initial document may be the
container PDF or one of the embedded documents.

NOTE 2 The page content in the initial document should contain
information that helps the user understand what is contained in the
collection, such as a title and an introductory paragraph.

The file attachments comprising a collection shall be located in the
**EmbeddedFiles** name tree. All attachments in that tree are in the
collection; any attachments not in that tree are not.

Table 155 describes the entries in a collection dictionary.

A *collection schema dictionary* consists of a variable number of
individual collection field dictionaries. Each collection field
dictionary has a key chosen by the conforming writer, which shall be
used to associate a field with data in a file specification. Table 156
describes the entries in a collection schema dictionary.

                               describes; if present, shall be
                               CollectionSchema for a collection
                               schema dictionary.

  **Other keys**  dictionary   (*Optional*) A collection field
                               dictionary. Each key name is
                               chosen at the discretion of the
                               conforming writer. The key name
                               shall be used to identify a
                               corresponding collection item
                               dictionary referenced from the
                               file specification dictionary\'s
                               CI entry (see CI key in Table 44).
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

A *collection field dictionary* describes the attributes of a particular
field in a portable collection, including the type of data stored in the
field and the lookup key used to locate the field data in the file
specification dictionary. Table 157 describes the entries in a
collection field dictionary.

A *collection sort dictionary* identifies the fields that shall be used
to sort items in the collection. The type of sorting depends on the type
of data:

- Text strings shall be ordered lexically from smaller to larger, if
  ascending order is specified.

NOTE 3 Lexical ordering is an implementation dependency for conforming
readers.

- Numbers shall be ordered numerically from smaller to larger, if
  ascending order is specified.

- Dates shall be ordered from oldest to newest, if ascending order is
  specified.

Table 158 describes the entries in a collection sort dictionary.

+:=========+:=========+======================================+
| **Type** | name     | (*Optional*) The type of PDF object  |
|          |          | that this dictionary describes; if   |
|          |          | present, shall be CollectionSort for |
|          |          | a collection sort dictionary.        |
+----------+----------+--------------------------------------+
| **S**    | name or  | (*Required*) The name or names of    |
|          | array    | fields that the conforming reader    |
|          |          | shall use to sort the items in the   |
|          |          | collection. If the value is a name,  |
|          |          | it identifies a field described in   |
|          |          | the parent collection dictionary.    |
|          |          |                                      |
|          |          | If the value is an array, each       |
|          |          | element of the array shall be a name |
|          |          | that identifies a field described in |

|          |          | The array form shall be used to      |
|          |          | allow additional fields to           |
|          |          | contribute to the sort, where each   |
|          |          | additional field shall be used to    |
|          |          | break ties. More specifically, if    |
|          |          | multiple collection item             |
|          |          | dictionaries have the same value for |
|          |          | the first field named in the array,  |
|          |          | the values for successive fields     |
|          |          | named in the array shall be used for |
|          |          | sorting, until a unique order is     |
|          |          | determined or until the named fields |

|          | or array | boolean, it specifies whether the    |
|          |          | conforming reader shall sort the     |
|          |          | items in the collection in ascending |
|          |          | order (**true**) or descending order |
|          |          | (**false**). If the value is an      |
|          |          | array, each element of the array     |
|          |          | shall be a boolean value that        |
|          |          | specifies whether the entry at the   |
|          |          | same index in the **S** array shall  |
|          |          | be sorted in ascending or descending |
|          |          | order.                               |
|          |          |                                      |
|          |          | If the number of entries in the      |
|          |          | **A** array is larger than the       |
|          |          | number of entries in the **S** array |
|          |          | the extra entries in the **A** array |
|          |          | shall be ignored. If the number of   |
|          |          | entries in the **A** array is less   |
|          |          | than the number of entries in the    |
|          |          | **S** array the missing entries in   |
|          |          | the **A** array shall be assumed to  |
|          |          | be **true**.                         |

EXAMPLE 1 This example shows a collection dictionary representing an
email in-box, where each item in the collection is an email message. The
actual email messages are contained in file specification dictionaries.
The organizational data associated with each email is described in a
collection schema dictionary. Most actual organizational data (from, to,
date, and subject) is provided in a collection item dictionary, but the
size data comes from the embedded file parameter dictionary.

### 12.4 Page-Level Navigation

**12.4.1 General**

This sub-clause describes PDF facilities that enable the user to
navigate from page to page within a document:

- *Page labels* for numbering or otherwise identifying individual pages
  (see 12.4.2, "Page Labels").

- *Article threads*, which chain together items of content within the
  document that are logically connected but not physically sequential
  (see 12.4.3, "Articles").

- *Presentations* that display the document in the form of a slide show,
  advancing from one page to the next either automatically or under user
  control (see 12.4.4, "Presentations").

For another important form of page-level navigation, see 12.5.6.5, "Link
Annotations."

**12.4.2 Page Labels**

Each page in a PDF document shall be identified by an integer *page
index* that expresses the page's relative position within the document.
In addition, a document may optionally define *page labels (PDF 1.3)* to
identify each page visually on the screen or in print. Page labels and
page indices need not coincide: the indices shall be fixed, running
consecutively through the document starting from 0 for the first page,
but the labels may be specified in any way that is appropriate for the
particular document.

NOTE 1 If the document begins with 12 pages of front matter numbered in
roman numerals and the remainder of the document is numbered in arabic,
the first page would have a page index of 0 and a page label of i, the
twelfth page would have index 11 and label xii, and the thirteenth page
would have index 12 and label 1.

For purposes of page labelling, a document shall be divided into
*labelling ranges*, each of which is a series of consecutive pages using
the same numbering system. Pages within a range shall be numbered
sequentially in ascending order. A page's label consists of a numeric
portion based on its position within its labelling range, optionally
preceded by a *label prefix denoting the range itself*.

NOTE 2 The pages in an appendix might be labeled with decimal numeric
portions prefixed with the string A-; the resulting page labels would be
A-1, A-2, and so on.

A document's labelling ranges shall be defined by the **PageLabels**
entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2, "Document Catalog"). The
value of this entry shall be a number tree (7.9.7, "Number Trees"), each
of whose keys is the page index of the first page in a labelling range.
The corresponding value shall be a *page label dictionary* defining the
labelling characteristics for the pages in that range. The tree shall
include a value for page index 0. Table 159 shows the contents of a page
label dictionary.

**12.4.3 Articles**

Some types of documents may contain sequences of content items that are
logically connected but not physically sequential.

EXAMPLE 1 A news story may begin on the first page of a newsletter and
run over onto one or more nonconsecutive interior pages.

To represent such sequences of physically discontiguous but logically
related items, a PDF document may define one or more *articles (PDF
1.1)*. The sequential flow of an article shall be defined by an *article
thread*; the individual content items that make up the article are
called *beads* on the thread. Conforming readers may provide navigation
facilities to allow the user to follow a thread from one bead to the
next.

The optional **Threads** entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2,
"Document Catalog") holds an array of *thread dictionaries* (Table 160)
defining the document's articles. Each individual bead within a thread
shall be represented by a *bead dictionary* (Table 161). The thread
dictionary's **F** entry shall refer to the first bead in the thread;
the beads shall be chained together sequentially in a doubly linked list
through their **N** (next) and **V** (previous) entries. In addition,
for each page on which article beads appear, the page object (see 7.7.3,
"Page Tree") shall contain a **B** entry whose value is an array of
indirect references to the beads on the page, in drawing order.

                          creation date. The contents of this
                          dictionary shall conform to the syntax for
                          the document information dictionary (see

**12.4.4 Presentations**

**12.4.4.1 General**

Some conforming readers may allow a document to be displayed in the form
of a *presentation* or slide show, advancing from one page to the next
either automatically or under user control. In addition, PDF 1.5
introduces the ability to advance between different states of the same
page (see 12.4.4.2, "Sub-page Navigation").

NOTE 1 PDF 1.4 introduces a different mechanism, known as alternate
presentations, for slide show displays, described in 13.5, "Alternate
Presentations."

A page object (see 7.7.3, "Page Tree") may contain two optional entries,
**Dur** and **Trans** *(PDF 1.1)*, to specify how to display that page
in presentation mode. The **Trans** entry shall contain a *transition
dictionary* describing the style and duration of the visual transition
to use when moving from another page to the given page during a
presentation. Table 162 shows the contents of the transition dictionary.
(Some of the entries shown are needed only for certain transition
styles, as indicated in the table.)

The **Dur** entry in the page object specifies the page's *display
duration* (also called its *advance timing*): the maximum length of
time, in seconds, that the page shall be displayed before the
presentation automatically advances to the next page.

NOTE 2 The user can advance the page manually before the specified time
has expired.

If no **Dur** entry is specified in the page object, the page shall not
advance automatically.

NOTE 3 Figure 56 illustrates the relationship between transition
duration (**D** in the transition dictionary) and display duration
(**Dur** in the page object). Note that the transition duration
specified for a page (page 2 in the figure) governs the transition to
that page from another page; the transition from the page is governed by
the next page's transition duration.

> **Figure 56 -- Presentation timing**

EXAMPLE The following example shows the presentation parameters for a
page to be displayed for 5 seconds. Before the page is displayed, there
is a 3.5-second transition in which two vertical lines sweep outward
from the center to the edges of the page.

**12.4.4.2 Sub-page Navigation**

*Sub-page navigation (PDF 1.5)* provides the ability to navigate not
only between pages but also between different states of the same page.

NOTE 1 A single page in a PDF presentation could have a series of bullet
points that could be individually turned on and off. In such an example,
the bullets would be represented by optional content (see 8.11.2,
"Optional Content Groups"), and each state of the page would be
represented as a *navigation node*.

NOTE 2 Conforming readers should save the state of optional content
groups when a user enters presentation mode and restore it when
presentation mode ends. This ensures, for example, that transient
changes to bullets do not affect the printing of the document.

A navigation node dictionary (see Table 163) specifies actions to
execute when the user makes a navigation request.

EXAMPLE Pressing an arrow key.

The navigation nodes on a page form a doubly linked list by means of
their **Next** and **Prev** entries. The primary node on a page shall be
determined by the optional **PresSteps** entry in a page dictionary (see
Table 30).

NOTE 3 A conforming reader should respect navigation nodes only when in
presentation mode (see 12.4.4,

> "Presentations").
>
> **Table 163 -- Entries in a navigation node dictionary**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**     **Value**
  ---------- ------------ ------------------------------------------
  **Type**   name         *(Optional)* The type of PDF object that
                          this dictionary describes; shall be
                          **NavNode** for a navigation node
                          dictionary.

  **NA**     dictionary   *(Optional)* An action (which may be the
                          first in a sequence of actions) that shall
                          be executed when a user navigates forward.

  **PA**     dictionary   *(Optional)* An action (which may be the
                          first in a sequence of actions) that shall
                          be executed when a user navigates
                          backward.

  **Next**   dictionary   *(Optional)* The next navigation node, if
                          any.

  **Prev**   dictionary   *(Optional)* The previous navigation node,
                          if any.

  **Dur**    number       *(Optional)* The maximum number of seconds
                          before the conforming reader shall
                          automatically advance forward to the next
                          navigation node. If this entry is not
                          specified, no automatic advance shall
                          occur.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

A conforming reader shall maintain a *current* navigation node. When a
user navigates to a page, if the page dictionary has a **PresSteps**
entry, the node specified by that entry shall become the current node.
(Otherwise, there is no current node.) If the user requests to navigate
forward (such as an arrow key press) and there is a current navigation
node, the following shall occur:

a)  The sequence of actions specified by **NA** (if present) shall be
    executed.

> If **NA** specifies an action that navigates to another page, the
> following actions for navigating to another page take place, and
> **Next** should not be present.

b)  The node specified by **Next** (if present) shall become the new
    current navigation node.

Similarly, if the user requests to navigate backward and there is a
current navigation node, the following shall occur:

a)  The sequence of actions specified by **PA** (if present) shall be
    executed.

> If **PA** specifies an action that navigates to another page, the
> following actions for navigating to another page take place, and
> **Prev** should not be present.

b)  The node specified by **Prev** (if present) shall become the new
    current navigation node.

Transition effects, similar to the page transitions described earlier,
may be specified as transition actions that are part of the **NA** or
**PA** sequence; see 12.6.4.14, "Transition Actions."

If the user requests to navigate to another page (regardless of whether
there is a current node) and that page's dictionary contains a
**PresSteps** entry, the following shall occur:

a)  The navigation node represented by **PresSteps** shall become the
    current node.

b)  If the navigation request was forward, or if the navigation request
    was for random access (such as by clicking on a link), the actions
    specified by **NA** shall be executed and the node specified by
    **Next** shall become the new current node, as described previously.

> If the navigation request was backward, the actions specified by
> **PA** shall be executed and the node specified by **Prev** shall
> become the new current node, as described previously.

c)  The conforming reader shall make the new page the current page and
    shall display it. Any page transitions specified by the **Trans**
    entry of the page dictionary shall be performed.

###  12.5 Annotations

**12.5.1 General**

An *annotation* associates an object such as a note, sound, or movie
with a location on a page of a PDF document, or provides a way to
interact with the user by means of the mouse and keyboard. PDF includes
a wide variety of standard annotation types, described in detail in
12.5.6, "Annotation Types."

Many of the standard annotation types may be displayed in either the
*open* or the *closed* state. When closed, they appear on the page in
some distinctive form, such as an icon, a box, or a rubber stamp,
depending on the specific annotation type. When the user *activates* the
annotation by clicking it, it exhibits its associated object, such as by
opening a pop-up window displaying a text note (Figure 57) or by playing
a sound or a movie.

+=============================================+

> **Figure 57 -- Open annotation**

Conforming readers may permit the user to navigate through the
annotations on a page by using the keyboard (in particular, the tab
key). Beginning with PDF 1.5, PDF producers may make the navigation
order explicit with the optional **Tabs** entry in a page object (see
Table 30). The following are the possible values for this entry:

- R (row order): Annotations shall be visited in rows running
  horizontally across the page. The direction within a row shall be
  determined by the **Direction** entry in the viewer preferences
  dictionary (see 12.2, "Viewer Preferences"). The first annotation that
  shall be visited is the first annotation in the topmost row. When the
  end of a row is encountered, the first annotation in the next row
  shall be visited.

- C (column order): Annotations shall be visited in columns running
  vertically up and down the page. Columns shall be ordered by the
  **Direction** entry in the viewer preferences dictionary (see 12.2,
  "Viewer Preferences"). The first annotation that shall be visited is
  the one at the top of the first column. When the end of a column is
  encountered, the first annotation in the next column shall be visited.

- S (structure order): Annotations shall be visited in the order in
  which they appear in the structure tree (see 14.7, "Logical
  Structure"). The order for annotations that are not included in the
  structure tree shall be determined in a manner of the conforming
  reader\'s choosing.

These descriptions assume the page is being viewed in the orientation
specified by the **Rotate** entry.

Conceptually, the behaviour of each annotation type may be implemented
by a software module called an *annotation handler*. A conforming reader
shall provide annotation handlers for all of the conforming annotation
types. The set of annotation types is extensible. A conforming reader
shall provide certain expected behaviour for all annotation types that
it does not recognize, as documented in 12.5.2, "Annotation
Dictionaries."

**12.5.2 Annotation Dictionaries**

The optional **Annots** entry in a page object (see 7.7.3, "Page Tree")
holds an array of *annotation dictionaries*, each representing an
annotation associated with the given page. Table 164 shows the required
and optional entries that are common to all annotation dictionaries. The
dictionary may contain additional entries specific to a particular
annotation type; see the descriptions of individual annotation types in
12.5.6, "Annotation Types," for details. A given annotation dictionary
shall be referenced from the **Annots** array of only one page. This
requirement applies only to the annotation dictionary itself, not to
subsidiary objects, which may be shared among multiple annotations.

|            |                | not restrict deletion of the          |

+------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+

If the NoZoom flag is set, the annotation shall always maintain the same
fixed size on the screen and shall be unaffected by the magnification
level at which the page itself is displayed. Similarly, if the NoRotate
flag is set, the annotation shall retain its original orientation on the
screen when the page is rotated (by changing the Rotate entry in the
page object; see 7.7.3, "Page Tree").

In either case, the annotation's position shall be determined by the
coordinates of the upper-left corner of its annotation rectangle, as
defined by the **Rect** entry in the annotation dictionary and
interpreted in the default user space of the page. When the default user
space is scaled or rotated, the positions of the other three corners of
the annotation rectangle are different in the altered user space than
they were in the original user space. The conforming reader shall
perform this alteration automatically. However, it shall not actually
change the annotation's **Rect** entry, which continues to describe the
annotation's relationship with the unscaled, unrotated user space.

NOTE Figure 58 shows how an annotation whose NoRotate flag is set
remains upright when the page it is on is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
The upper-left corner of the annotation remains at the same point in
default user space; the annotation pivots around that point.

**12.5.4 Border Styles**

An annotation may optionally be surrounded by a border when displayed or
printed. If present, the border shall be drawn completely inside the
annotation rectangle. In PDF 1.1, the characteristics of the border
shall be specified by the **Border** entry in the annotation dictionary
(see Table 164). Beginning with PDF 1.2, the border characteristics for
some types of annotations may instead be specified in a *border style
dictionary* designated by the annotation's **BS** entry. Such
dictionaries may also be used to specify the width and dash pattern for
the lines drawn by line, square, circle, and ink annotations. Table 166
summarizes the contents of the border style dictionary. If neither the
**Border** nor the **BS** entry is present, the border shall be drawn as
a solid line with a width of 1 point.

Beginning with PDF 1.5, some annotations (square, circle, and polygon)
may have a **BE** entry, which is a *border effect dictionary* that
specifies an effect that shall be applied to the border of the
annotations. Beginning with PDF 1.6, the free text annotation may also
have a **BE** entry. Table 167 describes the entries in a border effect
dictionary.

**12.5.5 Appearance Streams**

Beginning with PDF 1.2, an annotation may specify one or more
*appearance streams* as an alternative to the simple border and colour
characteristics available in earlier versions. Appearance streams enable
the annotation to be presented visually in different ways to reflect its
interactions with the user. Each appearance stream is a form XObject
(see 8.10, "Form XObjects"): a self-contained content stream that shall
be rendered inside the annotation rectangle.

The algorithm outlined in this sub-clause shall be used to map from the
coordinate system of the appearance XObject (as defined by its
**Matrix** entry; see Table 97) to the annotation's rectangle in default
user space:

> **Algorithm: Appearance streams**

a)  The appearance's bounding box (specified by its **BBox** entry)
    shall be transformed, using **Matrix**, to produce a quadrilateral
    with arbitrary orientation. The *transformed appearance box* is the
    smallest upright rectangle that encompasses this quadrilateral.

b)  A matrix *A* shall be computed that scales and translates the
    transformed appearance box to align with the edges of the
    annotation's rectangle (specified by the **Rect** entry). *A* maps
    the lower-left corner (the corner with the smallest *x* and *y*
    coordinates) and the upper-right corner (the corner with the
    greatest *x* and *y* coordinates) of the transformed appearance box
    to the corresponding corners of the annotation's rectangle.

c)  **Matrix** shall be concatenated with *A* to form a matrix *AA* that
    maps from the appearance's coordinate system to the annotation's
    rectangle in default user space:

> *AA* = **Matrix** ¥ *A*

The annotation may be further scaled and rotated if either the NoZoom or
NoRotate flag is set (see 12.5.3, "Annotation Flags"). Any
transformation applied to the annotation as a whole shall also applied
to the appearance within it.

Starting with PDF 1.4, an annotation appearance may include
transparency. If the appearance's stream dictionary does not contain a
**Group** entry, it shall be treated as a non-isolated, non-knockout
transparency group. Otherwise, the isolated and knockout values
specified in the group dictionary (see 11.6.6, "Transparency Group
XObjects") shall be used.

The transparency group shall be composited with a backdrop consisting of
the page content along with any previously painted annotations, using a
blend mode of **Normal**, an alpha constant of 1.0, and a soft mask of
**None**.

NOTE 1 If a transparent annotation appearance is painted over an
annotation that is drawn without using an appearance stream, the effect
is implementation-dependent. This is because such annotations are
sometimes drawn by means that do not conform to the PDF imaging model.
Also, the effect of highlighting a transparent annotation appearance is
implementation-dependent.

An annotation may define as many as three separate appearances:

- The *normal appearance* shall be used when the annotation is not
  interacting with the user. This appearance is also used for printing
  the annotation.

- The *rollover appearance* shall be used when the user moves the cursor
  into the annotation's active area without pressing the mouse button.

- The *down appearance* shall be used when the mouse button is pressed
  or held down within the annotation's active area.

NOTE 2 As used here, the term mouse denotes a generic pointing device
that controls the location of a cursor on the screen and has at least
one button that can be pressed, held down, and released. See 12.6.3,
"Trigger Events," for further discussion.

The normal, rollover, and down appearances shall be defined in an
*appearance dictionary*, which in turn is the value of the AP entry in
the annotation dictionary (see Table 164). Table 168 shows the contents
of the appearance dictionary.

> **Table 168 -- Entries in an appearance dictionary**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**      **Value**
  --------- ------------- ---------------------------------------
  **N**     stream or     *(Required)* The annotation's normal
            dictionary    appearance.

  **R**     stream or     *(Optional)* The annotation's rollover
            dictionary    appearance. Default value: the value of
                          the **N** entry.

  **D**     stream or     *(Optional)* The annotation's down
            dictionary    appearance. Default value: the value of
                          the **N** entry.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

Each entry in the appearance dictionary may contain either a single
appearance stream or an *appearance subdictionary*. In the latter case,
the subdictionary shall define multiple appearance streams corresponding
to different *appearance states* of the annotation.

EXAMPLE An annotation representing an interactive check box may have two
appearance states named On and Off. Its appearance dictionary may be
defined as

> /AP \<\< /N \<\< /On *formXObject*~1~
>
> /Off *formXObject*2
>
> \>\>
>
> /D \<\< /On *formXObject*~3~
>
> /Off *formXObject*4
>
> \>\>

\>\>

NOTE 3 If a conforming reader does not have native support for a
particular annotation type conforming readers shall display the
annotation with its normal (**N**) appearance. Conforming readers shall
also attempt to provide reasonable behavior (such as displaying nothing)
if an annotation's **AS** entry designates an appearance state for which
no appearance is defined in the appearance dictionary.

For convenience in managing appearance streams that are used repeatedly,
the **AP** entry in a PDF document's name dictionary (see 7.7.4, "Name
Dictionary") may contain a name tree mapping name strings to appearance
streams. The name strings have no standard meanings; no PDF objects may
refer to appearance streams by name.

**12.5.6 Annotation Types**

**12.5.6.1 General**

PDF supports the standard annotation types listed in Table 169. The
following sub-clauses describe each of these types in detail.

The values in the first column of Table 169 represent the value of the
annotation dictionary's **Subtype** entry. The third column indicates
whether the annotation is a *markup annotation*, as described in
12.5.6.2, "Markup Annotations." The sub-clause also provides more
information about the value of the **Contents** entry for different
annotation types.

**12.5.6.2 Markup Annotations**

As mentioned in 12.5.2, "Annotation Dictionaries," the meaning of an
annotation's **Contents** entry varies by annotation type. Typically, it
is the text that shall be displayed for the annotation or, if the
annotation does not display text, an alternate description of the
annotation's contents in human-readable form. In either case, the
**Contents** entry is useful when extracting the document's contents in
support of accessibility to users with disabilities or for other
purposes (see 14.9.3, "Alternate Descriptions").

Many annotation types are defined as *markup annotations* because they
are used primarily to mark up PDF documents (see Table 170). These
annotations have text that appears as part of the annotation and may be
displayed in other ways by a conforming reader, such as in a Comments
pane.

Markup annotations may be divided into the following groups:

- Free text annotations display text directly on the page. The
  annotation's **Contents** entry specifies the displayed text.

- Most other markup annotations have an associated pop-up window that
  may contain text. The annotation's **Contents** entry specifies the
  text that shall be displayed when the pop-up window is opened. These
  include text, line, square, circle, polygon, polyline, highlight,
  underline, squiggly-underline, strikeout, rubber stamp, caret, ink,
  and file attachment annotations.

- Sound annotations do not have a pop-up window but may also have
  associated text specified by the **Contents** entry.

When separating text into paragraphs, a CARRIAGE RETURN (0Dh) shall be
used and not, for example, a LINE FEED character (0Ah).

NOTE 1 A subset of markup annotations is called text markup annotations
(see 12.5.6.10, "Text Markup Annotations").

The remaining annotation types are not considered markup annotations:

- The pop-up annotation type shall not appear by itself; it shall be
  associated with a markup annotation that uses it to display text.

NOTE 2 If an annotation has no parent, the **Contents** entry shall
represent the text of the annotation, otherwise it shall be ignored by a
conforming reader.

- For all other annotation types (**Link**, **Movie**, **Widget**,
  **PrinterMark**, and **TrapNet**), the **Contents** entry shall
  provide an alternate representation of the annotation's contents in
  human-readable form, which is useful when extracting the document's
  contents in support of accessibility to users with disabilities or for
  other purposes (see 14.9.3, "Alternate Descriptions").

Table 170 lists entries that apply to all markup annotations.

+------------+------------+----------------------------------------+

In PDF 1.6, a set of annotations may be grouped so that they function as
a single unit when a user interacts with them. The group consists of a
*primary annotation*, which shall not have an **IRT** entry, and one or
more *subordinate annotations*, which shall have an **IRT** entry that
refers to the primary annotation and an **RT** entry whose value is
**Group**.

Some entries in the primary annotation are treated as "group attributes"
that shall apply to the group as a whole; the corresponding entries in
the subordinate annotations shall be ignored. These entries are
**Contents** (or **RC** and **DS**), **M**, **C**, **T**, **Popup**,
**CreationDate**, **Subj**, and **Open**. Operations that manipulate any
annotation in a group, such as movement, cut, and copy, shall be treated
by conforming readers as acting on the entire group.

NOTE 3 A primary annotation may have replies that are not subordinate
annotations; that is, that do not have an *RT* value of **Group**.

**12.5.6.3 Annotation States**

Beginning with PDF 1.5, annotations may have an author-specific *state*
associated with them. The state is not specified in the annotation
itself but in a separate text annotation that refers to the original
annotation by means of its **IRT** ("in reply to") entry (see Table
173). States shall be grouped into a number of *state models*, as shown
in Table 171.

> **Table 171 -- Annotation states**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  **State      **State**   **Description**
  model**                  
  ------------ ----------- -----------------------------------------
  **Marked**   Marked      The annotation has been marked by the
                           user.

               Unmarked    The annotation has not been marked by the
                           user (the default).

  **Review**   Accepted    The user agrees with the change.

               Rejected    The user disagrees with the change.

               Cancelled   The change has been cancelled.

               Completed   The change has been completed.

               None        The user has indicated nothing about the
                           change (the default).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

Annotations shall be thought of as initially being in the default state
for each state model. State changes made by a user shall be indicated in
a text annotation with the following entries:

- The **T** entry (see Table 170) shall specify the user.

- The **IRT** entry (see Table 173) shall refer to the original
  annotation.

- **State** and **StateModel** (see Table 172) shall update the state of
  the original annotation for the specified user.

Additional state changes shall be made by adding text annotations in
reply to the previous reply for a given user.

**12.5.6.4 Text Annotations**

A *text annotation* represents a "sticky note" attached to a point in
the PDF document. When closed, the annotation shall appear as an icon;
when open, it shall display a pop-up window containing the text of the
note in a font and size chosen by the conforming reader. Text
annotations shall not scale and rotate with the page; they shall behave
as if the NoZoom and NoRotate annotation flags (see Table 165) were
always set. Table 172 shows the annotation dictionary entries specific
to this type of annotation.

|                |          | provide predefined icon appearances    |
|                |          | for at least the following standard    |

**12.5.6.5 Link Annotations**

A *link annotation* represents either a hypertext link to a destination
elsewhere in the document (see 12.3.2, "Destinations") or an action to
be performed (12.6, "Actions"). Table 173 shows the annotation
dictionary entries specific to this type of annotation.

**12.5.6.6 Free Text Annotations**

A *free text annotation (PDF 1.3)* displays text directly on the page.
Unlike an ordinary text annotation (see 12.5.6.4, "Text Annotations"), a
free text annotation has no open or closed state; instead of being
displayed in a pop-up window, the text shall be always visible. Table
174 shows the annotation dictionary entries specific to this type of
annotation. 12.7.3.3, "Variable Text" describes the process of using
these entries to generate the appearance of the text in these
annotations.

**12.5.6.8 Square and Circle Annotations**

*Square* and *circle annotations (PDF 1.3)* shall display, respectively,
a rectangle or an ellipse on the page. When opened, they shall display a
pop-up window containing the text of the associated note. The rectangle
or ellipse shall be inscribed within the annotation rectangle defined by
the annotation dictionary's **Rect** entry (see Table 168).

Figure 63 shows two annotations, each with a border width of 18 points.
Despite the names *square* and *circle*, the width and height of the
annotation rectangle need not be equal. Table 177 shows the annotation
dictionary entries specific to these types of annotations.

**12.5.6.15 File Attachment Annotations**

A *file attachment annotation (PDF 1.3)* contains a reference to a file,
which typically shall be embedded in the PDF file (see 7.11.4, "Embedded
File Streams").

NOTE A table of data might use a file attachment annotation to link to a
spreadsheet file based on that data; activating the annotation extracts
the embedded file and gives the user an opportunity to view it or store
it in the file system. Table 184 shows the annotation dictionary entries
specific to this type of annotation.

The **Contents** entry of the annotation dictionary may specify
descriptive text relating to the attached file. Conforming readers shall
use this entry rather than the optional **Desc** entry *(PDF 1.6)* in
the file specification dictionary (see Table 44) identified by the
annotation's **FS** entry.

**12.5.6.16 Sound Annotations**

A *sound annotation* *(PDF 1.2)* shall analogous to a text annotation
except that instead of a text note, it contains sound recorded from the
computer's microphone or imported from a file. When the annotation is
activated, the sound shall be played. The annotation shall behave like a
text annotation in most ways, with a different icon (by default, a
speaker) to indicate that it represents a sound. Table 185 shows the
annotation dictionary entries specific to this type of annotation. Sound
objects are discussed in 13.3, "Sounds."

**12.5.6.17 Movie Annotations**

A *movie annotation (PDF 1.2)* contains animated graphics and sound to
be presented on the computer screen and through the speakers. When the
annotation is activated, the movie shall be played. Table 186 shows the
annotation dictionary entries specific to this type of annotation.
Movies are discussed in 13.4, "Movies." **Table 186 -- Additional
entries specific to a movie annotation**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**       **Type**     **Value**
  ------------- ------------ -----------------------------------------
  **Subtype**   name         *(Required)* The type of annotation that
                             this dictionary describes; shall be
                             **Movie** for a movie annotation.

  **T**         text string  (*Optional*) The title of the movie
                             annotation. Movie actions (12.6.4.9,
                             "Movie Actions") may use this title to
                             reference the movie annotation.

  **Movie**     dictionary   *(Required)* A movie dictionary that
                             shall describe the movie's static
                             characteristics (see 13.4, "Movies").

  **A**         boolean or   *(Optional)* A flag or dictionary
                dictionary   specifying whether and how to play the
                             movie when the annotation is activated.
                             If this value is a dictionary, it shall
                             be a movie activation dictionary (see
                             13.4, "Movies") specifying how to play
                             the movie. If the value is the boolean
                             **true**, the movie shall be played using
                             default activation parameters. If the
                             value is **false***,* the movie shall not
                             be played. Default value: **true**.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.5.6.18 Screen Annotations**

A *screen annotation (PDF 1.5)* specifies a region of a page upon which
media clips may be played. It also serves as an object from which
actions can be triggered. 12.6.4.13, "Rendition Actions" discusses the
relationship between screen annotations and rendition actions. Table 187
shows the annotation dictionary entries specific to this type of
annotation.

> **Table 187 -- Additional entries specific to a screen annotation**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**       **Type**     **Value**
  ------------- ------------ -----------------------------------------
  **Subtype**   name         *(Required)* The type of annotation that
                             this dictionary describes; shall be
                             **Screen** for a screen annotation.

  **T**         text string  (*Optional*) The title of the screen
                             annotation.

  **MK**        dictionary   *(Optional)* An appearance
                             characteristics dictionary (see Table
                             189). The **I** entry of this dictionary
                             provides the icon used in generating the
                             appearance referred to by the screen
                             annotation's **AP** entry.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Table 187 -- Additional entries specific to a screen annotation
> (continued)**

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**     **Value**
  --------- ------------ -----------------------------------------
  **A**     dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.1)* An action that
                         shall be performed when the annotation is
                         activated (see 12.6, "Actions").

  **AA**    dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.2)* An
                         additional-actions dictionary defining
                         the screen annotation's behaviour in
                         response to various trigger events (see
                         12.6.3, "Trigger Events").
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the entries in Table 187, screen annotations may use the
common entries in the annotation dictionary (see Table 164) in the
following ways:

- The **P** entry shall be used for a screen annotation referenced by a
  rendition action. It shall reference a valid page object, and the
  annotation shall be present in the page's **Annots** array for the
  action to be valid.

- The **AP** entry refers to an appearance dictionary (see Table 168)
  whose normal appearance provides the visual appearance for a screen
  annotation that shall be used for printing and default display when a
  media clip is not being played. If **AP** is not present, the screen
  annotation shall not have a default visual appearance and shall not be
  printed.

**12.5.6.19 Widget Annotations**

Interactive forms (see 12.7, "Interactive Forms") use *widget
annotations (PDF 1.2)* to represent the appearance of fields and to
manage user interactions. As a convenience, when a field has only a
single associated widget annotation, the contents of the field
dictionary (12.7.3, "Field Dictionaries") and the annotation dictionary
may be merged into a single dictionary containing entries that pertain
to both a field and an annotation.

NOTE This presents no ambiguity, since the contents of the two kinds of
dictionaries do not conflict.

Table 188 shows the annotation dictionary entries specific to this type
of annotation; interactive forms and fields are discussed at length in
12.7, "Interactive Forms."

**12.5.6.20 Printer's Mark Annotations**

A *printer's mark annotation (PDF 1.4)* represents a graphic symbol,
such as a registration target, colour bar, or cut mark, that may be
added to a page to assist production personnel in identifying components
of a multipleplate job and maintaining consistent output during
production. See 14.11.3, "Printer's Marks," for further discussion.

**12.5.6.21 Trap Network Annotations**

A *trap network annotation (PDF 1.3)* may be used to define the trapping
characteristics for a page of a PDF document.

NOTE *Trapping* is the process of adding marks to a page along colour
boundaries to avoid unwanted visual artifacts resulting from
misregistration of colorants when the page is printed.

A page shall have no more than one trap network annotation, whose
**Subtype** entry has the value **TrapNet** and which shall always be
the last element in the page object's **Annots** array (see 7.7.3.3,
"Page Objects"). See 14.11.6, "Trapping Support," for further
discussion.

**12.5.6.22 Watermark Annotations**

A *watermark annotation (PDF 1.6)* shall be used to represent graphics
that shall be printed at a fixed size and position on a page, regardless
of the dimensions of the printed page. The FixedPrint entry of a
watermark annotation dictionary (see Table 190) shall be a dictionary
that contains values for specifying the size and position of the
annotation (see Table 191).

Watermark annotations shall have no pop-up window or other interactive
elements. When displaying a watermark annotation on-screen, conforming
readers shall use the dimensions of the media box as the page size so
that the scroll and zoom behaviour is the same as for other annotations.

NOTE Since many printing devices have non printable margins, such
margins should be taken into consideration when positioning watermark
annotations near the edge of a page.

|            |          | represents 100% and 0.0 represents 0%. |
|            |          | Negative values should not be used,    |
|            |          | since they may cause content to be     |
|            |          | drawn off the page.                    |
|            |          |                                        |

|            |          | a percentage of the height of the      |
|            |          | target media (or if unknown, the       |
|            |          | height of the page's **MediaBox**).    |
|            |          | 1.0 represents 100% and 0.0 represents |
|            |          | 0%. Negative values should not be      |
|            |          | used, since they may cause content to  |
|            |          | be drawn off the page.                 |

+------------+----------+----------------------------------------+

When rendering a watermark annotation with a **FixedPrint** entry, the
following behaviour shall occur:

- The annotation's rectangle (as specified by its **Rect** entry) shall
  be translated to the origin and transformed by the **Matrix** entry of
  its **FixedPrint** dictionary to produce a quadrilateral with
  arbitrary orientation.

- The *transformed annotation rectangle* shall be defined as the
  smallest upright rectangle that encompasses this quadrilateral; it
  shall be used in place of the annotation rectangle referred to in
  steps 2 and 3 of \"Algorithm: Appearance streams\".

In addition, given a matrix *B* that maps a scaled and rotated page into
the default user space, a new matrix shall be computed that cancels out
*B* and translates the origin of the printed page to the origin of the
default user space. This transformation shall be applied to ensure the
correct scaling and alignment.

EXAMPLE The following example shows a watermark annotation that prints a
text string one inch from the left and one inch from the top of the
printed page.

In situations other than the usual case where the PDF page size equals
the printed page size, watermark annotations with a **FixedPrint** entry
shall be printed in the following manner:

- When page tiling is selected in a conforming reader (that is, a single
  PDF page is printed on multiple pages), the annotations shall be
  printed at the specified size and position on each page to ensure that
  any enclosed content is present and legible on each printed page.

- When *n*-up printing is selected (that is, multiple PDF pages are
  printed on a single page), the annotations shall be printed at the
  specified size and shall be positioned as if the dimensions of the
  printed page were limited to a single portion of the page. This
  ensures that any enclosed content does not overlap content from other
  pages, thus rendering it illegible.

**12.5.6.23 Redaction Annotations**

A redaction annotation (*PDF 1.7*) identifies content that is intended
to be removed from the document. The intent of redaction annotations is
to enable the following process:

a)  *Content identification*. A user applies redact annotations that
    specify the pieces or regions of content that should be removed. Up
    until the next step is performed, the user can see, move and
    redefine these annotations.

b)  *Content removal*. The user instructs the viewer application to
    apply the redact annotations, after which the content in the area
    specified by the redact annotations is removed. In the removed
    content's place, some marking appears to indicate the area has been
    redacted. Also, the redact annotations are removed from the PDF
    document.

Redaction annotations provide a mechanism for the first step in the
redaction process (content identification). This allows content to be
marked for redaction in a non-destructive way, thus enabling a review
process for evaluating potential redactions prior to removing the
specified content.

Redaction annotations shall provide enough information to be used in the
second phase of the redaction process (content removal). This phase is
application-specific and requires the conforming reader to remove all
content identified by the redaction annotation, as well as the
annotation itself.

Conforming readers that support redaction annotations shall provide a
mechanism for applying content removal, and they shall remove all traces
of the specified content. If a portion of an image is contained in a
redaction region, that portion of the image data shall be destroyed;
clipping or image masks shall not be used to hide that data. Such
conforming readers shall also be diligent in their consideration of all
content that can exist in a PDF document, including XML Forms
Architecture (XFA) content and Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP)
content.

                                be **Redact** for a redaction
                                annotation.

  **QuadPoints**    array       (*Optional*) An array of 8 x n numbers
                                specifying the coordinates of n

                                as described in Table 175 for text
                                markup annotations. If present, these
                                quadrilaterals denote the content
                                region that is intended to be removed.
                                If this entry is not present, the
                                **Rect** entry denotes the content
                                region that is intended to be removed.

  **IC**            array       (*Optional*) An array of three numbers

                                space, of the interior colour with
                                which to fill the redacted region after
                                the affected content has been removed.
                                If this entry is absent, the interior
                                of the redaction region is left
                                transparent. This entry is ignored if

                                redaction is applied and the affected
                                content has been removed, the overlay
                                appearance should be drawn such that
                                its origin lines up with the lower-left
                                corner of the annotation rectangle.
                                This form XObject is not necessarily
                                related to other annotation
                                appearances, and may or may not be
                                present in the **AP** dictionary. This
                                entry takes precedence over the **IC**,
                                **OverlayText**, **DA**, and **Q**

                                over the redacted region after the
                                affected content has been removed. This
                                entry is ignored if the **RO** entry is
                                present.

  **Repeat**        boolean     (*Optional*) If **true**, then the text
                                specified by **OverlayText** should be
                                repeated to fill the redacted region
                                after the affected content has been
                                removed. This entry is ignored if the
                                **RO** entry is present. Default value:
                                **false**.

                                formatting the overlay text when it is
                                drawn after the affected content has
                                been removed (see 12.7.3.3, "Variable
                                Text"). This entry is ignored if the
                                **RO** entry is present.

### 12.6 Actions

**12.6.1 General**

In addition to jumping to a destination in the document, an annotation
or outline item may specify an *action (PDF 1.1)* to perform, such as
launching an application, playing a sound, changing an annotation's
appearance state. The optional **A** entry in the annotation or outline
item dictionary (see Tables 168 and 153) specifies an action performed
when the annotation or outline item is activated; in PDF 1.2, a variety
of other circumstances may trigger an action as well (see 12.6.3,
"Trigger Events"). In addition, the optional OpenAction entry in a
document's catalogue (7.7.2, "Document Catalog") may specify an action
that shall be performed when the document is opened. PDF includes a wide
variety of standard action types, described in detail in 12.6.4, "Action

Types."

**12.6.2 Action Dictionaries**

An *action dictionary* defines the characteristics and behaviour of an
action. Table 193 shows the required and optional entries that are
common to all action dictionaries. The dictionary may contain additional
entries specific to a particular action type; see the descriptions of
individual action types in 12.6.4, "Action Types," for details.

> **Table 193 -- Entries common to all action dictionaries**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**      **Value**
  ---------- ------------- --------------------------------------
  **Type**   name          *(Optional)* The type of PDF object
                           that this dictionary describes; if
                           present, shall be **Action** for an
                           action dictionary.

  **S**      name          *(Required)* The type of action that
                           this dictionary describes; see Table
                           194 for specific values.

  **Next**   dictionary or *(Optional; PDF 1.2)* The next action
             array         or sequence of actions that shall be
                           performed after the action represented
                           by this dictionary. The value is
                           either a single action dictionary or
                           an array of action dictionaries that
                           shall be performed in order; see the
                           Note for further discussion.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 The action dictionary's **Next** entry *(PDF 1.2)* allows
sequences of actions to be chained together. For example, the effect of
clicking a link annotation with the mouse might be to play a sound, jump
to a new page, and start up a movie. Note that the **Next** entry is not
restricted to a single action but may contain an array of actions, each
of which in turn may have a **Next** entry of its own. The actions may
thus form a tree instead of a simple linked list. Actions within each
**Next** array are executed in order, each followed in turn by any
actions specified in *its* **Next** entry, and so on recursively.
Conforming readers should attempt to provide reasonable behavior in
anomalous situations. For example, self-referential actions should not
be executed more than once, and actions that close the document or
otherwise render the next action impossible should terminate the
execution sequence. Applications should also provide some mechanism for
the user to interrupt and manually terminate a sequence of actions.

PDF 1.5 introduces transition actions, which allow the control of
drawing during a sequence of actions; see

12.6.4.14, "Transition Actions."

NOTE 2 No action should modify its own action dictionary or any other in
the action tree in which it resides. The effect of such modification on
subsequent execution of actions in the tree is undefined.

**12.6.3 Trigger Events**

An annotation, page object, or (beginning with PDF 1.3) interactive form
field may include an entry named AA that specifies an
*additional-actions dictionary (PDF 1.2)* that extends the set of events
that can trigger the execution of an action. In PDF 1.4, the document
catalogue dictionary (see 7.7.2, "Document Catalog") may also contain an
**AA** entry for trigger events affecting the document as a whole.
Tables 194 to 197 show the contents of this type of dictionary.

PDF 1.5 introduces four trigger events in annotation's
additional-actions dictionary to support multimedia presentations:

- The PO and **PC** entries have a similar function to the **O** and
  **C** entries in the page object's additionalactions dictionary (see
  Table 194). However, associating these triggers with annotations
  allows annotation objects to be self-contained.

EXAMPLE Annotations containing such actions can be copied or moved
between pages without requiring page open/close actions to be changed.

- The **PV** and **PI** entries allow a distinction between pages that
  are open and pages that are visible. At any one time, while more than
  one page may be visible, depending on the page layout.

NOTE 1 For these trigger events, the values of the flags specified by
the annotation's **F** entry (see 12.5.3, "Annotation Flags") have no
bearing on whether a given trigger event occurs.

                         an action.

  **C**     dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.2)* An action that shall
                         be performed when the page is closed (for
                         example, when the user navigates to the next
                         or previous page or follows a link
                         annotation or an outline item). This action
                         applies to the page being closed and shall
                         be executed before any other page is opened.

  **K**     dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.3)* A JavaScript action
                         that shall be performed when the user
                         modifies a character in a text field or
                         combo box or modifies the selection in a
                         scrollable list box. This action may check
                         the added text for validity and reject or
                         modify it.

  **F**     dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.3)* A JavaScript action
                         that shall be performed before the field is
                         formatted to display its value. This action
                         may modify the field's value before
                         formatting.

  **V**     dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.3)* A JavaScript action
                         that shall be performed when the field's
                         value is changed. This action may check the
                         new value for validity. (The name V stands
                         for "validate.")

  **C**     dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.3)* A JavaScript action
                         that shall be performed to recalculate the
                         value of this field when that of another
                         field changes. (The name **C** stands for
                         "calculate.") The order in which the
                         document's fields are recalculated shall be
                         defined by the **CO** entry in the
                         interactive form dictionary (see 12.7.2,
                         "Interactive Form Dictionary").

Conforming readers shall ensure the presence of such a device, or
equivalent controls for simulating one, for the corresponding actions to
be executed correctly. Mouse-related trigger events are subject to the
following constraints:

- An **E** (enter) event may occur only when the mouse button is up.

- An **X** (exit) event may not occur without a preceding **E** event.

- A **U** (up) event may not occur without a preceding **E** and **D**
  event.

- In the case of overlapping or nested annotations, entering a second
  annotation's active area causes an **X** event to occur for the first
  annotation.

NOTE 2 The field-related trigger events ***K*** (keystroke), ***F***
(format), ***V*** (validate), and ***C*** (calculate) are not defined
for button fields (see 12.7.4.2, "Button Fields"). The effects of an
action triggered by one of these events are limited only by the action
itself and can occur outside the described scope of the event. For
example, even though the ***F*** event is used to trigger actions that
format field values prior to display, it is possible for an action
triggered by this event to perform a calculation or make any other
modification to the document.

> These field-related trigger events can occur either through user
> interaction or programmatically, such as in response to the
> **NeedAppearances** entry in the interactive form dictionary (see
> 12.7.2, "Interactive Form Dictionary"), importation of FDF data
> (12.7.7, "Forms Data Format"), or JavaScript actions (12.6.4.16,
>
> "JavaScript Actions"). For example, the user's modifying a field value
> can trigger a cascade of calculations and further formatting and
> validation for other fields in the document.

**12.6.4.2 Go-To Actions**

A *go-to action* changes the view to a specified destination (page,
location, and magnification factor). Table 199 shows the action
dictionary entries specific to this type of action.

| **S**   | name     | *(Required)* The type of action that     |
|         |          | this dictionary describes; shall be      |
|         |          | **GoTo** for a go-to action.             |
+---------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **D**   | name,    | *(Required)* The destination to jump to  |
|         |          | (see 12.3.2, "Destinations").            |
|         | byte     |                                          |

+---------+----------+------------------------------------------+

NOTE Specifying a go-to action in the **A** entry of a link annotation
or outline item (see Table 173 and Table 153) has the same effect as
specifying the destination directly with the **Dest** entry. For
example, the link annotation shown in the Example in 12.6.4.12,
"Set-OCG-State Actions," which uses a go-to action, has the same effect
as the one in the following Example, which specifies the destination
directly. However, the go-to action is less compact and is not
compatible with PDF 1.0; therefore, using a direct destination is
preferable.

**12.6.4.3 Remote Go-To Actions**

A *remote go-to action* is similar to an ordinary go-to action but jumps
to a destination in another PDF file instead of the current file. Table
200 shows the action dictionary entries specific to this type of action.

NOTE Remote go-to actions cannot be used with embedded files; see
12.6.4.4, "Embedded Go-To Actions."

+---------------+---------------+---------------------------------------+

**12.6.4.4 Embedded Go-To Actions**

An *embedded go-to action (PDF 1.6)* is similar to a remote go-to action
but allows jumping to or from a PDF file that is embedded in another PDF
file (see 7.11.4, "Embedded File Streams"). Embedded files may be
associated with file attachment annotations (see 12.5.6.15, "File
Attachment Annotations") or with entries in the **EmbeddedFiles** name
tree (see 7.7.4, "Name Dictionary"). Embedded files may in turn contain
embedded files. Table 201 shows the action dictionary entries specific
to embedded go-to actions.

Embedded go-to actions provide a complete facility for linking between a
file in a hierarchy of nested embedded files and another file in the
same or different hierarchy. The following terminology shall be used:

- The *source* is the document containing the embedded go-to action.

- The *target* is the document in which the destination lives.

- The **T** entry in the action dictionary is a target dictionary that
  locates the target in relation to the source, in much the same way
  that a relative path describes the physical relationship between two
  files in a file system. Target dictionaries may be nested recursively
  to specify one or more intermediate targets before reaching the final
  one. As the hierarchy is navigated, each intermediate target shall be
  referred to as the *current document*. Initially, the source is the
  current document.

NOTE It is an error for a target dictionary to have an infinite cycle
(for example, one where a target dictionary refers to itself).
Conforming readers should attempt to detect such cases and refuse to
execute the action if found.

- A *child* document shall be one that is embedded within another PDF
  file.

- The document in which a file is embedded shall be its *parent*.

- A *root document* is one that is not embedded in another PDF file. The
  target and source may be contained in root documents or embedded
  documents.

**12.6.4.5 Launch Actions**

A *launch action* launches an application or opens or prints a document.
Table 203 shows the action dictionary entries specific to this type of
action.

The optional **Win**, **Mac**, and **Unix** entries allow the action
dictionary to include platform-specific parameters for launching the
designated application. If no such entry is present for the given
platform, the **F** entry shall be used instead. Table 203 shows the
platform-specific launch parameters for the Windows platform. Parameters
for the Mac OS and UNIX platforms are not yet defined at the time of
publication.

                                  absent and the conforming reader does
                                  not understand any of the alternative
                                  entries, it shall do nothing.

  **Win**         dictionary      *(Optional)* A dictionary containing

                                  is **false**, the destination document
                                  replaces the current document in the
                                  same window. If this entry is absent,
                                  the conforming reader should behave in
                                  accordance with its current preference.
                                  This entry shall be ignored if the file

**12.6.4.7 URI Actions**

A *uniform resource identifier* (URI) is a string that identifies
(*resolves* to) a resource on the Internet---typically a file that is
the destination of a hypertext link, although it may also resolve to a
query or other entity. (URIs are described in Internet RFC 2396,
*Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax*; see the
Bibliography.)

A *URI action* causes a URI to be resolved. Table 206 shows the action
dictionary entries specific to this type of action.

> **Table 206 -- Additional entries specific to a URI action**

+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **Key**   | **Type** | **Value**                                 |
+:==========+:=========+:==========================================+
| **S**     | name     | *(Required)* The type of action that this |
|           |          | dictionary describes; shall be **URI**    |
|           |          | for a URI action.                         |
+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **URI**   | ASCII    | *(Required)* The uniform resource         |
|           | string   | identifier to resolve, encoded in 7-bit   |
|           |          | ASCII.                                    |
+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **IsMap** | boolean  | *(Optional)* A flag specifying whether to |
|           |          | track the mouse position when the URI is  |
|           |          | resolved (see the discussion following    |
|           |          | this Table). Default value: **false**.    |
|           |          |                                           |
|           |          | This entry applies only to actions        |
|           |          | triggered by the user's clicking an       |
|           |          | annotation; it shall be ignored for       |
|           |          | actions associated with outline items or  |
|           |          | with a document's **OpenAction** entry.   |
+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------------+

If the **IsMap** flag is **true** and the user has triggered the URI
action by clicking an annotation, the coordinates of the mouse position
at the time the action has been triggered shall be transformed from
device space to user space and then offset relative to the upper-left
corner of the annotation rectangle (that is, the value of the **Rect**
entry in the annotation with which the URI action is associated).

EXAMPLE 1 If the mouse coordinates in user space are (*x~m~* , *y~m~* )
and the annotation rectangle extends from (*ll~x\ ~*, *ll~y~* ) at the
lower-left to (*ur~x~* , *ur~y~* ) at the upper-right, the final
coordinates (*x~f~* , *y~f\ ~*) are as follows:

(*xf* = *xm* -- *llx*)

> *yf* = *ury* -- *ym*

If the resulting coordinates (*x~f~* , *y~f~* ) are fractional, they
shall be rounded to the nearest integer values. They shall then be
appended to the URI to be resolved, separated by COMMAS (2Ch) and
preceded by a QUESTION MARK (3Fh), as shown in this example:

EXAMPLE 2 http : / / www . adobe . com / intro ?100 , 200

NOTE 1 To support URI actions, a PDF document's **Catalog** (see 7.7.2,
"Document Catalog") may include a **URI** entry whose value is a *URI
dictionary*. Only one entry shall be defined for such a dictionary (see
Table 207).

> **Table 207 -- Entry in a URI dictionary**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**   **Value**
  ---------- ---------- -------------------------------------------
  **Base**   ASCII      *(Optional)* The *base URI* that shall be
             string     used in resolving relative URI references.
                        URI actions within the document may specify
                        URIs in partial form, to be interpreted
                        relative to this base address. If no base
                        URI is specified, such partial URIs shall
                        be interpreted relative to the location of
                        the document itself. The use of this entry
                        is parallel to that of the body element
                        \<BASE \>, as described in the *HTML 4.01
                        Specification* (see the Bibliography).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 The **Base** entry allows the URI of the document to be recorded
in situations in which the document may be accessed out of context. For
example, if a document has been moved to a new location but contains
relative links to other documents that have not been moved, the **Base**
entry could be used to refer such links to the true location of the
other documents, rather than that of the moved document.

**12.6.4.8 Sound Actions**

A *sound action (PDF 1.2)* plays a sound through the computer's
speakers. Table 208 shows the action dictionary entries specific to this
type of action. Sounds are discussed in 13.3, "Sounds."

> **Table 208 -- Additional entries specific to a sound action**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**           **Type**   **Value**
  ----------------- ---------- ---------------------------------------
  **S**             name       *(Required)* The type of action that
                               this dictionary describes; shall be
                               **Sound** for a sound action.

  **Sound**         stream     *(Required)* A sound object defining
                               the sound that shall be played (see
                               13.3, "Sounds").

  **Volume**        number     *(Optional)* The volume at which to
                               play the sound, in the range −1.0 to
                               1.0. Default value: 1.0.

  **Synchronous**   boolean    *(Optional)* A flag specifying whether
                               to play the sound synchronously or
                               asynchronously. If this flag is
                               **true**, the conforming reader retains
                               control, allowing no further user
                               interaction other than canceling the
                               sound, until the sound has been
                               completely played. Default value:
                               **false**.

  **Repeat**        boolean    *(Optional)* A flag specifying whether
                               to repeat the sound indefinitely. If
                               this entry is present, the
                               **Synchronous** entry shall be ignored.
                               Default value: **false**.

  **Mix**           boolean    *(Optional)* A flag specifying whether
                               to mix this sound with any other sound
                               already playing. If this flag is
                               **false**, any previously playing sound
                               shall be stopped before starting this
                               sound; this can be used to stop a
                               repeating sound (see **Repeat**).
                               Default value: **false**.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.6.4.9 Movie Actions**

A *movie action (PDF 1.2)* can be used to play a movie in a floating
window or within the annotation rectangle of a movie annotation (see
12.5.6.17, "Movie Annotations" and 13.4, "Movies"). The movie annotation
shall be associated with the page that is the destination of the link
annotation or outline item containing the movie action, or with the page
object with which the action is associated.

NOTE A movie action by itself does not guarantee that the page the movie
is on will be displayed before attempting to play the movie; such page
change actions shall be done explicitly.

The contents of a movie action dictionary are identical to those of a
movie activation dictionary (see Table 296), with the additional entries
shown in Table 209. The contents of the activation dictionary associated
with the movie annotation provide the default values. Any information
specified in the movie action dictionary overrides these values.

**12.6.4.10 Hide Actions**

A *hide action (PDF 1.2)* hides or shows one or more annotations on the
screen by setting or clearing their Hidden flags (see 12.5.3,
"Annotation Flags"). This type of action can be used in combination with
appearance streams and trigger events (Sections 12.5.5, "Appearance
Streams," and 12.6.3, "Trigger Events") to display pop-up help
information on the screen.

NOTE The **E** (enter) and **X** (exit) trigger events in an
annotation's additional-actions dictionary can be used to show and hide
the annotation when the user rolls the cursor in and out of its active
area on the page. This can be used to pop up a help label, or tool tip,
describing the effect of clicking at that location on the page.

Table 210 shows the action dictionary entries specific to this type of
action.

|                |          | the next name is encountered:            |
|                |          |                                          |
|                |          | **ON** sets the state of subsequent      |
|                |          | groups to **ON**                         |
|                |          |                                          |
|                |          | **OFF** sets the state of subsequent     |
|                |          | groups to **OFF Toggle** reverses the    |
|                |          | state of subsequent groups.              |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **PreserveRB** | boolean  | *(Optional)* If **true**, indicates that |
|                |          | radio-button state relationships between |
|                |          | optional content groups (as specified by |
|                |          | the **RBGroups** entry in the current    |
|                |          | configuration dictionary; see Table 101) |
|                |          | should be preserved when the states in   |
|                |          | the **State** array are applied. That    |
|                |          | is, if a group is set to **ON** (either  |
|                |          | by **ON** or **Toggle**) during          |
|                |          | processing of the **State** array, any   |
|                |          | other groups belonging to the same       |
|                |          | radio-button group shall be turned       |
|                |          | **OFF**. If a group is set to **OFF**,   |
|                |          | there is no effect on other groups.      |
|                |          |                                          |
|                |          | If **PreserveRB** is **false**,          |
|                |          | radio-button state relationships, if     |
|                |          | any, shall be ignored.                   |
|                |          |                                          |
|                |          | Default value: **true**.                 |
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------------+

When a set-OCG-state action is performed, the **State** array shall be
processed from left to right. Each name shall be applied to subsequent
groups in the array until the next name is encountered, as shown in the
following example.

EXAMPLE 1 \<\< /S /SetOCGState

> /State \[/OFF 2 0 R 3 0 R /Toggle 16 0 R 19 0 R /ON 5 0 R\] \>\>

A group may appear more than once in the **State** array; its state
shall be set each time it is encountered, based on the most recent name.
**ON**, **OFF** and **Toggle** sequences have no required order. More
than one sequence in the array may contain the same name.

EXAMPLE 2 If the array contained \[/OFF 1 0 R /Toggle 1 0 R\], the
group's state would be **ON** after the action was performed.

NOTE While the specification allows a group to appear more than once in
the ***State*** array, this is not intended to implement animation or
any other sequential drawing operations. PDF processing applications are
free to accumulate all state changes and apply only the net changes
simultaneously to all affected groups before redrawing.

**12.6.4.13 Rendition Actions**

A *rendition action (PDF 1.5)* controls the playing of multimedia
content (see 13.2, "Multimedia"). This action may be used in the
following ways:

- To begin the playing of a rendition object (see 13.2.3, "Renditions"),
  associating it with a screen annotation (see 12.5.6.18, "Screen
  Annotations"). The screen annotation specifies where the rendition
  shall be played unless otherwise specified.

- To stop, pause, or resume a playing rendition.

- To trigger the execution of a JavaScript script that may perform
  custom operations.

Table 214 lists the entries in a rendition action dictionary.

|         |            | optional*) An indirect reference to a     |
|         |            | screen annotation (see 12.5.6.18, "Screen |

| **OP**  | integer    | (*Required if **JS** is not present;      |
|         |            | otherwise optional*) The operation to     |
|         |            | perform when the action is triggered.     |
|         |            | Valid values shall be:                    |
|         |            |                                           |
|         |            | 1.  If no rendition is associated with    |
|         |            |     the annotation specified by **AN**,   |
|         |            |     play the rendition specified by       |
|         |            |     **R**, associating it with the        |
|         |            |     annotation. If a rendition is already |
|         |            |     associated with the annotation, it    |
|         |            |     shall be stopped, and the new         |
|         |            |     rendition shall be associated with    |
|         |            |     the annotation.                       |
|         |            |                                           |
|         |            | 2.  Stop any rendition being played in    |
|         |            |     association with the annotation       |
|         |            |     specified by **AN**, and remove the   |
|         |            |     association. If no rendition is being |
|         |            |     played, there is no effect.           |
|         |            |                                           |
|         |            | 3.  Pause any rendition being played in   |
|         |            |     association with the annotation       |
|         |            |     specified b y **AN**. If no rendition |
|         |            |     is being played, there is no effect.  |
|         |            |                                           |
|         |            | 4.  Resume any rendition being played in  |
|         |            |     association with the annotation       |
|         |            |     specified by **AN**. If no rendition  |
|         |            |     is being played or the rendition is   |
|         |            |     not paused, there is no effect.       |
|         |            |                                           |
|         |            | 5.  Play the rendition specified by       |
|         |            |     **R**, associating it with the        |
|         |            |     annotation specified by AN. If a      |
|         |            |     rendition is already associated with  |
|         |            |     the annotation, resume the rendition  |
|         |            |     if it is paused; otherwise, do        |
|         |            |     nothing.                              |
+---------+------------+-------------------------------------------+
| **JS**  | text       | (*Required if **OP** is not present;      |
|         | string or  | otherwise optional*) A text string or     |
|         | stream     | stream containing a JavaScript script     |
|         |            | that shall be executed when the action is |
|         |            | triggered.                                |
+---------+------------+-------------------------------------------+

Either the **JS** entry or the **OP** entry shall be present. If both
are present, **OP** is considered a fallback that shall be executed if
the conforming reader is unable to execute JavaScripts. If **OP** has an
unrecognized value and there is no **JS** entry, the action is invalid.

In some situations, a pause (**OP** value of 2) or resume (**OP** value
of 3) operation may not make sense or the player may not support it. In
such cases, the user should be notified of the failure to perform the
operation.

EXAMPLE A JPEG image

Before a rendition action is executed, the conforming reader shall make
sure that the **P** entry of the screen annotation dictionary references
a valid page object and that the annotation is present in the page
object's **Annots** array (see Table 30).

A rendition may play in the rectangle occupied by a screen annotation,
even if the annotation itself is not visible; for example, if its Hidden
or NoView flags (see Table 165) are set. If a screen annotation is not
visible because its location on the page is not being displayed by the
viewer, the rendition is not visible. However, it may become visible if
the view changes, such as by scrolling.

**12.6.4.14 Transition Actions**

A *transition action (PDF 1.5)* may be used to control drawing during a
sequence of actions. As discussed in 12.6.2, "Action Dictionaries," the
**Next** entry in an action dictionary may specify a sequence of
actions. Conforming readers shall normally suspend drawing when such a
sequence begins and resume drawing when it ends. If a transition action
is present during a sequence, the conforming reader shall render the
state of the page viewing area as it exists after completion of the
previous action and display it using a transition specified in the
action dictionary (see Table 215). Once this transition completes,
drawing shall be suspended again. **Table 215 -- Additional entries
specific to a transition action**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**     **Type**     **Value**
  ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------
  **S**       name         *(Required)* The type of action that this
                           dictionary describes; shall be **Trans**
                           for a transition action.

  **Trans**   dictionary   *(Required)* The transition to use for the
                           update of the display (see Table 162).
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.6.4.15 Go-To-3D-View Actions**

A *go-to-3D-view action (PDF 1.6)* identifies a 3D annotation and
specifies a view for the annotation to use (see 13.6, "3D Artwork").
Table 216 shows the entries in a go-to-3D-view action dictionary.

> **Table 216 -- Additional entries specific to a go-to-3D-view action**

+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Key** | **Type**   | **Value**                                |
+:========+:===========+==========================================+
| **S**   | name       | *(Required)* The type of action that     |
|         |            | this dictionary describes; shall be      |
|         |            | **GoTo3DView** for a transition action.  |
+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| **TA**  | dictionary | *(Required)* The target annotation for   |
|         |            | which to set the view.                   |
+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| **V**   | (various)  | *(Required)* The view to use. It may be  |
|         |            | one of the following types:              |
|         |            |                                          |
|         |            | A 3D view dictionary (see 13.6.4, "3D    |
|         |            | Views").                                 |
|         |            |                                          |
|         |            | An integer specifying an index into the  |
|         |            | **VA** array in the 3D stream (see Table |
|         |            | 300).                                    |
|         |            |                                          |
|         |            | A text string matching the **IN** entry  |
|         |            | in one of the views in the **VA** array  |
|         |            | (see Table 304).                         |
|         |            |                                          |
|         |            | A name that indicates the first (**F**), |
|         |            | last (**L**), next (**N**), previous     |
|         |            | (**P**), or default (**D**) entries in   |
|         |            | the **VA** array; see discussion         |
|         |            | following this Table.                    |
+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+

The **V** entry selects the view to apply to the annotation specified by
**TA**. This view may be one of the predefined views specified by the
**VA** entry of the 3D stream (see Table 300) or a unique view specified
here.

If the predefined view is specified by the names **N** (next) or **P**
(previous), it should be interpreted in the following way:

- When the last view applied was specified by means of the **VA** array,
  **N** and **P** indicate the next and previous entries, respectively,
  in the **VA** array (wrapping around if necessary).

- When the last view was not specified by means of **VA**, using **N**
  or **P** should result in reverting to the default view.

**12.6.4.16 JavaScript Actions**

Upon invocation of a JavaScript action, a conforming processor shall
execute a script that is written in the JavaScript programming language.
Depending on the nature of the script, various interactive form fields
in the document may update their values or change their visual
appearances. Mozilla Development Center's ClientSide JavaScript
Reference and the Adobe JavaScript for Acrobat API Reference (see the
Bibliography) give details on the contents and effects of JavaScript
scripts. Table 217 shows the action dictionary entries specific to this
type of action.

> **Table 217 -- Additional entries specific to a JavaScript action**

+---------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| **Key** | **Type** | **Value**                              |
+:========+:=========+========================================+
| **S**   | name     | *(Required)* The type of action that   |
|         |          | this dictionary describes; shall be    |
|         |          | **JavaScript** for a JavaScript        |
|         |          | action.                                |
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| **JS**  | text     | *(Required)* A text string or text     |
|         | string   | stream containing the JavaScript       |
|         | or text  | script to be executed.                 |
|         | stream   |                                        |
|         |          | ***PDFDocEncoding*** or Unicode        |
|         |          | encoding (the latter identified by the |
|         |          | Unicode prefix *U*+ *FEFF*) shall be   |
|         |          | used to encode the contents of the     |
|         |          | string or stream.                      |
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------+

To support the use of parameterized function calls in JavaScript
scripts, the **JavaScript** entry in a PDF document's name dictionary
(see 7.7.4, "Name Dictionary") may contain a name tree that maps name
strings to document-level JavaScript actions. When the document is
opened, all of the actions in this name tree shall be executed, defining
JavaScript functions for use by other scripts in the document.

NOTE The name strings associated with individual JavaScript actions in
the name dictionary serve merely as a convenient means for organizing
and packaging scripts. The names are arbitrary and need not bear any
relation to the JavaScript name space.

### 12.7 Interactive Forms

**12.7.1 General**

An *interactive form (PDF 1.2)*---sometimes referred to as an
*AcroForm*---is a collection of *fields* for gathering information
interactively from the user. A PDF document may contain any number of
fields appearing on any combination of pages, all of which make up a
single, global interactive form spanning the entire document. Arbitrary
subsets of these fields can be imported or exported from the document;
see 12.7.5, "Form Actions."

NOTE 1 Interactive forms should not be confused with form XObjects (see
8.10, "Form XObjects"). Despite the similarity of names, the two are
different, unrelated types of objects.

Each field in a document's interactive form shall be defined by a *field
dictionary* (see 12.7.3, "Field Dictionaries"). For purposes of
definition and naming, the fields can be organized hierarchically and
can inherit attributes from their ancestors in the field hierarchy. A
field's children in the hierarchy may also include widget annotations
(see 12.5.6.19, "Widget Annotations") that define its appearance on the
page. A field that has children that are fields is called a
*non-terminal field*. A field that does not have children that are
fields is called a *terminal field*.

A terminal field may have children that are widget annotations (see
12.5.6.19, "Widget Annotations") that define its appearance on the page.
As a convenience, when a field has only a single associated widget
annotation, the contents of the field dictionary and the annotation
dictionary (12.5.2, "Annotation Dictionaries") may be merged into a
single dictionary containing entries that pertain to both a field and an
annotation. (This presents no ambiguity, since the contents of the two
kinds of dictionaries do not conflict.) If such an object defines an
appearance stream, the appearance shall be consistent with the object's
current value as a field.

NOTE 2 Fields containing text whose contents are not known in advance
may need to construct their appearance streams dynamically instead of
defining them statically in an appearance dictionary; see 12.7.3.3,

**12.7.2 Interactive Form Dictionary**

The contents and properties of a document's interactive form shall be
defined by an *interactive form dictionary* that shall be referenced
from the **AcroForm** entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2,
"Document Catalog"). Table 218 shows the contents of this dictionary.

The value of the interactive form dictionary's **SigFlags** entry is an
unsigned 32-bit integer containing flags specifying various
document-level characteristics related to signature fields (see
12.7.4.5, "Signature Fields"). Bit positions within the flag word shall
be numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). Table 219 shows the
meanings of the flags; all undefined flag bits shall be reserved and
shall be set to 0.

  **1**        SignaturesExist   If set, the document contains at least
                                 one signature field. This flag allows
                                 a conforming reader to enable user
                                 interface items (such as menu items or
                                 pushbuttons) related to signature
                                 processing without having to scan the
                                 entire document for the presence of
                                 signature fields.

  **2**        AppendOnly        If set, the document contains
                                 signatures that may be invalidated if
                                 the file is saved (written) in a way
                                 that alters its previous contents, as
                                 opposed to an incremental update.
                                 Merely updating the file by appending
                                 new information to the end of the
                                 previous version is safe (see H.7,
                                 "Updating Example"). Conforming
                                 readers may use this flag to inform a
                                 user requesting a full save that
                                 signatures will be invalidated and
                                 require explicit confirmation before
                                 continuing with the operation.

**12.7.3 Field Dictionaries**

**12.7.3.1 General**

Each field in a document's interactive form shall be defined by a *field
dictionary*, which shall be an indirect object. The field dictionaries
may be organized hierarchically into one or more tree structures. Many
field attributes are *inheritable*, meaning that if they are not
explicitly specified for a given field, their values are taken from
those of its parent in the field hierarchy. Such inheritable attributes
shall be designated as such in the Tables 220 and 221. The designation
*(Required; inheritable)* means that an attribute shall be defined for
every field, whether explicitly in its own field dictionary or by
inheritance from an ancestor in the hierarchy. Table 220 shows those
entries that are common to all field dictionaries, regardless of type.
Entries that pertain only to a particular type of field are described in
the relevant sub-clauses in Table 220.

|          |            | defining the field's behaviour in     |
|          |            | response to various trigger events    |
|          |            | (see 12.6.3, "Trigger Events"). This  |
|          |            | entry has exactly the same meaning as |
|          |            | the **AA** entry in an annotation     |
|          |            | dictionary (see 12.5.2, "Annotation   |

+----------+------------+---------------------------------------+

The value of the field dictionary's **Ff** entry is an unsigned 32-bit
integer containing flags specifying various characteristics of the
field. Bit positions within the flag word shall be numbered from 1
(low-order) to 32 (highorder). The flags shown in Table 221 are common
to all types of fields. Flags that apply only to specific field types
are discussed in the sub-clauses describing those types. All undefined
flag bits shall be reserved and shall be set to 0.

> **Table 221 -- Field flags common to all field types**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Bit        **Name**   **Meaning**
  position**              
  ------------ ---------- ---------------------------------------
  **1**        ReadOnly   If set, the user may not change the
                          value of the field. Any associated
                          widget annotations will not interact
                          with the user; that is, they will not
                          respond to mouse clicks or change their
                          appearance in response to mouse
                          motions. This flag is useful for fields
                          whose values are computed or imported
                          from a database.

  **2**        Required   If set, the field shall have a value at
                          the time it is exported by a submitform
                          action (see 12.7.5.2, "Submit-Form
                          Action").

  **3**        NoExport   If set, the field shall not be exported
                          by a submit-form action (see 12.7.5.2,
                          "Submit-Form Action").
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

**12.7.3.2 Field Names**

The **T** entry in the field dictionary (see Table 220) holds a text
string defining the field's *partial field name*. The *fully qualified
field name* is not explicitly defined but shall be constructed from the
partial field names of the field and all of its ancestors. For a field
with no parent, the partial and fully qualified names are the same. For
a field that is the child of another field, the fully qualified name
shall be formed by appending the child field's partial name to the
parent's fully qualified name, separated by a PERIOD (2Eh) as shown:

> *parent's_full_name* . *child's_partial_name*

EXAMPLE If a field with the partial field name PersonalData has a child
whose partial name is Address, which in turn has a child with the
partial name ZipCode, the fully qualified name of this last field is

> PersonalData . Address . ZipCode

Because the PERIOD is used as a separator for fully qualified names, a
partial name shall not contain a PERIOD character. Thus, all fields
descended from a common ancestor share the ancestor's fully qualified
field name as a common prefix in their own fully qualified names.

It is possible for different field dictionaries to have the same fully
qualified field name if they are descendants of a common ancestor with
that name and have no partial field names (**T** entries) of their own.
Such field dictionaries are different representations of the same
underlying field; they should differ only in properties that specify
their visual appearance. In particular, field dictionaries with the same
fully qualified field name shall have the same field type (**FT**),
value (**V**), and default value (**DV**).

**12.7.3.3 Variable Text**

When the contents and properties of a field are known in advance, its
visual appearance can be specified by an appearance stream defined in
the PDF file (see 12.5.5, "Appearance Streams," and 12.5.6.19, "Widget
Annotations"). In some cases, however, the field may contain text whose
value is not known until viewing time.

NOTE Examples include text fields to be filled in with text typed by the
user from the keyboard, scrollable list boxes whose contents are
determined interactively at the time the document is displayed and
fields containing current dates or values calculated by a JavaScript.

In such cases, the PDF document cannot provide a statically defined
appearance stream for displaying the field. Instead, the conforming
reader shall construct an appearance stream dynamically at viewing time.
The dictionary entries shown in Table 222 provide general information
about the field's appearance that can be combined with the specific text
it contains to construct an appearance stream.

+---------+----------+--------------------------------------------+

The new appearance stream becomes the normal appearance (**N**) in the
appearance dictionary associated with the field's widget annotation (see
Table 168). (If the widget annotation has no appearance dictionary, the
conforming reader shall create one and store it in the annotation
dictionary's **AP** entry.)

In PDF 1.5, form fields that have the RichText flag set (see Table 226)
specify formatting information as described in 12.7.3.4, "Rich Text
Strings." For these fields, the following conventions are not used, and
the entire annotation appearance shall be regenerated each time the
value is changed.

For non-rich text fields, the appearance stream---which, like all
appearance streams, is a form XObject---has the contents of its form
dictionary initialized as follows:

- The resource dictionary (**Resources**) shall be created using
  resources from the interactive form dictionary's **DR** entry (see
  Table 218).

- The lower-left corner of the bounding box (**BBox**) is set to
  coordinates (0, 0) in the form coordinate system. The box's top and
  right coordinates are taken from the dimensions of the annotation
  rectangle (the **Rect** entry in the widget annotation dictionary).

- All other entries in the appearance stream's form dictionary are set
  to their default values (see 8.10, "Form XObjects").

EXAMPLE The appearance stream includes the following section of marked
content, which represents the portion of the stream that draws the text:

> /Tx BMC % Begin marked content with tag Tx q % Save graphics state
>
> ... *Any required graphics state changes, such as clipping* ...

BT % Begin text object

> ... *Default appearance string ( DA )* ...
>
> ... *Text-positioning and text-showing operators to show the variable
> text* ...

ET % End text object

> Q % Restore graphics state EMC % End marked content
>
> The **BMC** (begin marked content) and **EMC** (end marked content)
> operators are discussed in 14.6, "Marked Content." **q** (save
> graphics state) and **Q** (restore graphics state) are discussed in
> 8.4.4, "Graphics State Operators." **BT** (begin text object) and
> **ET** (end text object) are discussed in 9.4, "Text Objects." See
> Example 1 in 12.7.8, "XFA Forms" for an example.

The default appearance string (**DA**) contains any graphics state or
text state operators needed to establish the graphics state parameters,
such as text size and colour, for displaying the field's variable text.
Only operators that are allowed within text objects shall occur in this
string (see Figure 9). At a minimum, the string shall include a **Tf**
(text font) operator along with its two operands, *font* and *size*. The
specified *font* value shall match a resource name in the **Font** entry
of the default resource dictionary (referenced from the **DR** entry of
the interactive form dictionary; see Table 218). A zero value for *size*
means that the font shall be *auto-sized*: its size shall be computed as
a function of the height of the annotation rectangle.

The default appearance string shall contain at most one **Tm** (text
matrix) operator. If this operator is present, the conforming reader
shall replace the horizontal and vertical translation components with
positioning values it determines to be appropriate, based on the field
value, the quadding (**Q**) attribute, and any layout rules it employs.
If the default appearance string contains no **Tm** operator, the viewer
shall insert one in the appearance stream (with appropriate horizontal
and vertical translation components) after the default appearance string
and before the text-positioning and text-showing operators for the
variable text.

To update an existing appearance stream to reflect a new field value,
the conforming reader shall first copy any needed resources from the
document's **DR** dictionary (see Table 218) into the stream's
**Resources** dictionary. (If the **DR** and **Resources** dictionaries
contain resources with the same name, the one already in the
**Resources** dictionary shall be left intact, not replaced with the
corresponding value from the **DR** dictionary.) The conforming reader
shall then replace the existing contents of the appearance stream from
/Tx BMC to the matching EMC with the corresponding new contents as shown
in Example 1 in \"Check Boxes,\" 12.7.4, "Field Types." (If the existing
appearance stream contains no marked content with tag Tx, the new
contents shall be appended to the end of the original stream.)

**12.7.3.4 Rich Text Strings**

Beginning with PDF 1.5, the text contents of variable text form fields,
as well as markup annotations, may include formatting (style)
information. These *rich text strings* are fully-formed XML documents
that conform to the rich text conventions specified for the XML Forms
Architecture (XFA) specification, which is itself a subset of the XHTML
1.0 specification, augmented with a restricted set of CSS2 style
attributes (see the Bibliography for references to all these standards).

Table 223 lists the XHTML elements that may appear in rich text strings.
The \<body\> element is the root element; its required attributes are
listed in Table 224. Other elements (\<p\> and \<span\>) contain
enclosed text that may take style attributes, which are listed in Table
225. These style attributes are CSS inline style property declarations
of the form *name*:*value*, with each declaration separated by a
SEMICOLON (3Bh), as illustrated in the Example in \"Radio Buttons,\"
12.7.4, "Field Types."

In PDF 1.6, PDF supports the rich text elements and attributes specified
in the *XML Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.2* (see
Bibliography). These rich text elements and attributes are a superset of
those described in Table 223, Table 224 and Table 225. In PDF 1.7, PDF
supports the rich text elements and attributes specified in the *XML
Forms Architecture (XFA) Specification, 2.4* (see Bibliography).

  \<p\>         Encloses text that shall be interpreted as a
                paragraph. It may take the style attributes
                listed in Table 225.

  \<i\>         Encloses text that shall be displayed in an
                italic font.

  \<b\>         Encloses text that shall be displayed in a bold
                font.

+-------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+

Rich text strings shall be specified by the **RV** entry of variable
text form field dictionaries (see Table 222) and the **RC** entry of
markup annotation dictionaries (see Table 170). Rich text strings may be
packaged as *text streams* (see 7.9.3, "Text Streams"). Form fields
using rich text streams should also have the RichText flag set (see
Table 228).

A *default style string* shall be specified by the **DS** entry for free
text annotations (see Table 174) or variable text form fields (see Table
222). This string specifies the default values for style attributes,
which shall be used for any style attributes that are not explicitly
specified for the annotation or field. All attributes listed in Table
225 are legal in the default style string. This string, in addition to
the **RV** or **RC** entry, shall be used to generate the appearance.

NOTE 1 Markup annotations other than free text annotations (see
12.5.6.2, "Markup Annotations") do not use a default style string
because their appearances are implemented using platform controls
requiring the conforming reader to pick an appropriate system font for
display.

When a form field or annotation contains rich text strings, the *flat
text* (character data) of the string should also be preserved (in the
**V** entry for form fields and the **Contents** entry for annotations).
This enables older readers to read and edit the data (although with loss
of formatting information). The **DA** entry should be written out as
well when the file is saved.

When a rich text string specifies font attributes, the conforming reader
shall use font name selection as described in Section 15.3 of the CSS2
specification (see the Bibliography). Precedence should be given to the
fonts in the default resources dictionary, as specified by the **DR**
entry in Table 218.

EXAMPLE The following example illustrates the entries in a widget
annotation dictionary for rich text. The **DS** entry specifies the
default font. The **RV** entry contains two paragraphs of rich text: the
first paragraph specifies bold and italic text in the default font; the
second paragraph changes the font size.

**12.7.4 Field Types**

**12.7.4.1 General**

Interactive forms support the following field types:

- *Button fields* represent interactive controls on the screen that the
  user can manipulate with the mouse. They include *pushbuttons*, *check
  boxes*, and *radio buttons*.

- *Text fields* are boxes or spaces in which the user can enter text
  from the keyboard.

- *Choice fields* contain several text items, at most one of which may
  be selected as the field value. They include *scrollable* *list boxes*
  and *combo boxes*.

- *Signature fields* represent digital signatures and optional data for
  authenticating the name of the signer and the document's contents.

The following sub-clauses describe each of these field types in detail.
Further types may be added in the future.

**12.7.4.2 Button Fields**

**12.7.4.2.1 General**

A *button field* (field type **Btn**) represents an interactive control
on the screen that the user can manipulate with the mouse. There are
three types of button fields:

- A *pushbutton* is a purely interactive control that responds
  immediately to user input without retaining a permanent value (see
  12.7.4.2.2, "Pushbuttons").

- A *check box* toggles between two states, on and off (see 12.7.4.2.3,
  "Check Boxes").

- *Radio button fields* contain a set of related buttons that can each
  be on or off. Typically, at most one radio button in a set may be on
  at any given time, and selecting any one of the buttons automatically
  deselects all the others. (There are exceptions to this rule, as noted
  in \"Radio Buttons.\")

For button fields, bits 15, 16, 17, and 26 shall indicate the intended
behaviour of the button field. A conforming reader shall follow the
intended behaviour, as defined in Table 226 and clauses 12.7.4.2.2,
\"Pushbuttons\", 12.7.4.2.3, \"Check Boxes\" and 12.7.4.2.4, \"Radio
Buttons\".

> **Table 226 -- Field flags specific to button fields**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Bit        **Name**         **Meaning**
  position**                    
  ------------ ---------------- --------------------------------------
  15           NoToggleToOff    *(Radio buttons only)* If set, exactly
                                one radio button shall be selected at
                                all times; selecting the currently
                                selected button has no effect. If
                                clear, clicking the selected button
                                deselects it, leaving no button
                                selected.

  16           Radio            If set, the field is a set of radio
                                buttons; if clear, the field is a
                                check box. This flag may be set only
                                if the Pushbutton flag is clear.

  17           Pushbutton       If set, the field is a pushbutton that
                                does not retain a permanent value.

  26           RadiosInUnison   *(PDF 1.5)* If set, a group of radio
                                buttons within a radio button field
                                that use the same value for the on
                                state will turn on and off in unison;
                                that is if one is checked, they are
                                all checked. If clear, the buttons are
                                mutually exclusive (the same behavior
                                as HTML radio buttons).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.7.4.2.2 Pushbuttons**

A *pushbutton field* shall have a field type of **Btn** and the
Pushbutton flag (see Table 226) set to one. Because this type of button
retains no permanent value, it shall not use the **V** and **DV**
entries in the field dictionary (see Table 220).

**12.7.4.2.3 Check Boxes**

A *check box field* represents one or more check boxes that toggle
between two states, on and off, when manipulated by the user with the
mouse or keyboard. Its field type shall be **Btn** and its Pushbutton
and Radio flags (see Table 226) shall both be clear. Each state can have
a separate appearance, which shall be defined by an appearance stream in
the appearance dictionary of the field's widget annotation (see 12.5.5,
"Appearance Streams"). The appearance for the off state is optional but,
if present, shall be stored in the appearance dictionary under the name
**Off**. **Yes** should be used as the name for the on state.

The **V** entry in the field dictionary (see Table 220) holds a name
object representing the check box's appearance state, which shall be
used to select the appropriate appearance from the appearance
dictionary.

EXAMPLE 1 This example shows a typical check box definition.

>
> ET Q endstream endobj

Beginning with PDF 1.4, the field dictionary for check boxes and radio
buttons may contain an optional **Opt** entry (see Table 227). If
present, the **Opt** entry shall be an array of text strings
representing the export value of each annotation in the field. It may be
used for the following purposes:

- To represent the export values of check box and radio button fields in
  non-Latin writing systems. Because name objects in the appearance
  dictionary are limited to **PDFDocEncoding**, they cannot represent
  nonLatin text.

- To allow radio buttons or check boxes to be checked independently,
  even if they have the same export value.

EXAMPLE 2 A group of check boxes may be duplicated on more than one page
such that the desired behavior is that when a user checks a box, the
corresponding boxes on each of the other pages are also checked. In this
case, each of the corresponding check boxes is a widget in the **Kids**
array of a check box field.

NOTE For radio buttons, the same behavior shall occur only if the
*RadiosInUnison* flag is set. If it is not set, at most one radio button
in a field shall be set at a time.

|         |          | annotation.                                 |

|         |          | /1, /2) numerical position (starting with   |
|         |          | **0**) of the annotation in the **Kids**    |
|         |          | array, encoded as a name object. This       |
|         |          | allows distinguishing between the           |
|         |          | annotations even if two or more of them     |
|         |          | have the same value in the **Opt** array.   |
+---------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

**12.7.4.2.4 Radio Buttons**

A radio button field is a set of related buttons. Like check boxes,
individual radio buttons have two states, on and off. A single radio
button may not be turned off directly but only as a result of another
button being turned on. Typically, a set of radio buttons (annotations
that are children of a single radio button field) have at most one
button in the on state at any given time; selecting any of the buttons
automatically deselects all the others.

NOTE An exception occurs when multiple radio buttons in a field have the
same on state and the RadiosInUnison flag is set. In that case, turning
on one of the buttons turns on all of them.

The field type is **Btn**, the Pushbutton flag (see Table 226) is clear,
and the Radio flag is set. This type of button field has an additional
flag, NoToggleToOff, which specifies, if set, that exactly one of the
radio buttons shall be selected at all times. In this case, clicking the
currently selected button has no effect; if the NoToggleToOff flag is
clear, clicking the selected button deselects it, leaving no button
selected.

The **Kids** entry in the radio button field's field dictionary (see
Table 220) holds an array of widget annotations representing the
individual buttons in the set. The parent field's **V** entry holds a
name object corresponding to the appearance state of whichever child
field is currently in the on state; the default value for this entry is
Off.

EXAMPLE This example shows the object definitions for a set of radio
buttons.

Like a check box field, a radio button field may use the optional
**Opt** entry in the field dictionary *(PDF 1.4)* to define export
values for its constituent radio buttons, using Unicode (UTF-16BE)
encoding for non-Latin characters (see Table 227).

**12.7.4.3 Text Fields**

A *text field* (field type **Tx**) is a box or space for text fill-in
data typically entered from a keyboard. The text may be restricted to a
single line or may be permitted to span multiple lines, depending on the
setting of the Multiline flag in the field dictionary's **Ff** entry.
Table 228 shows the flags pertaining to this type of field. A text field
shall have a field type of **Tx**. A conforming PDF file, and a
conforming processor shall obey the usage guidelines in Table 228.

|            |                 | field in the PDF file if this flag  |
|            |                 | is set.                             |

|            |                 | noninteractive form filling, the    |
|            |                 | filler should take care not to add  |
|            |                 | more character than will visibly    |
|            |                 | fit in the defined area.            |
+------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+
| 25         | Comb            | *(PDF 1.5)* May be set only if the  |
|            |                 | **MaxLen** entry is present in the  |
|            |                 | text field dictionary (see Table    |
|            |                 | 229) and if the Multiline,          |
|            |                 | Password, and FileSelect flags are  |
|            |                 | clear. If set, the field shall be   |
|            |                 | automatically divided into as many  |
|            |                 | equally spaced positions, or        |
|            |                 | *combs*, as the value of            |
|            |                 | **MaxLen**, and the text is laid    |
|            |                 | out into those combs.               |
+------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+
| 26         | RichText        | *(PDF 1.5)* If set, the value of    |
|            |                 | this field shall be a rich text     |
|            |                 | string (see 12.7.3.4, "Rich Text    |
|            |                 | Strings"). If the field has a       |
|            |                 | value, the **RV** entry of the      |
|            |                 | field dictionary (Table 222) shall  |
|            |                 | specify the rich text string.       |
+------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------+

The field's text shall be held in a text string (or, beginning with PDF
1.5, a stream) in the **V** (value) entry of the field dictionary. The
contents of this text string or stream shall be used to construct an
appearance stream for displaying the field, as described under 12.7.3.3,
"Variable Text." The text shall be presented in a single style (font,
size, colour, and so forth), as specified by the **DA** (default
appearance) string.

If the FileSelect flag *(PDF 1.4)* is set, the field shall function as a
*file-select control*. In this case, the field's text represents the
pathname of a file whose contents shall be submitted as the field's
value:

- For fields submitted in HTML Form format, the submission shall use the
  MIME content type multipart / formdata, as described in Internet RFC
  2045, *Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), Part One: Format
  of Internet Message Bodies* (see the Bibliography).

- For Forms Data Format (FDF) submission, the value of the **V** entry
  in the FDF field dictionary (see FDF Fields in 12.7.7.3, "FDF
  Catalog") shall be a file specification (7.11, "File Specifications")
  identifying the selected file.

- XML format is not supported for file-select controls; therefore, no
  value shall be submitted in this case.

Besides the usual entries common to all fields (see Table 220) and to
fields containing variable text (see Table 222), the field dictionary
for a text field may contain the additional entry shown in Table 229.

  **MaxLen**   integer    *(Optional; inheritable)* The maximum
                          length of the field's text, in characters.

**12.7.4.4 Choice Fields**

A *choice field* shall have a field type of **Ch** that contains several
text items, one or more of which shall be selected as the field value.
The items may be presented to the user in one of the following two
forms:

- A scrollable *list box*

- A *combo box* consisting of a drop-down list. The combo box may be
  accompanied by an editable text box in which the user can type a value
  other than the predefined choices, as directed by the value of the
  Edit bit in the **Ff** entry.

> **Table 230 -- Field flags specific to choice fields**

  18           Combo          If set, the field is a combo box;
                              if clear, the field is a list box.

  19           Edit           If set, the combo box shall include
                              an editable text box as well as a
                              drop-down list; if clear, it shall
                              include only a drop-down list. This
                              flag shall be used only if the
                              Combo flag is set.

|            |                   | case, supplying a value for a     |
|            |                   | field involves three actions:     |
|            |                   | selecting the field for fill-in,  |
|            |                   | selecting a choice for the        |
|            |                   | fill-in value, and leaving that   |
|            |                   | field, which finalizes or         |
|            |                   | "commits" the data choice and     |

|            |                   | with the entry or changing of     |
|            |                   | this data. If this flag is on,    |

|            |                   | field. If clear, the new value is |
|            |                   | not committed until the user      |
|            |                   | exits the field.                  |

| **Opt** | array    | *(Optional)* An array of options that shall |
|         |          | be presented to the user. Each element of   |
|         |          | the array is either a text string           |
|         |          | representing one of the available options   |
|         |          | or an array consisting of two text strings: |
|         |          | the option's export value and the text that |

| **I**   | array    | *(Sometimes required, otherwise optional;   |

|         |          | multiple selection (MultiSelect flag set),  |
|         |          | an array of integers, sorted in ascending   |
|         |          | order, representing the zero-based indices  |
|         |          | in the **Opt** array of the currently       |
|         |          | selected option items. This entry shall be  |
|         |          | used when two or more elements in the       |
|         |          | **Opt** array have different names but the  |
|         |          | same export value or when the value of the  |
|         |          | choice field is an array. This entry should |
|         |          | not be used for choice fields that do not   |
|         |          | allow multiple selection. If the items      |
|         |          | identified by this entry differ from those  |
|         |          | in the **V** entry of the field dictionary  |
|         |          | (see discussion following this Table), the  |
|         |          | **V** entry shall be used.                  |
+---------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

The **Opt** array specifies the list of options in the choice field,
each of which shall be represented by a text string that shall be
displayed on the screen. Each element of the **Opt** array contains
either this text string by itself or a two-element array, whose second
element is the text string and whose first element is a text string
representing the export value that shall be used when exporting
interactive form field data from the document.

The field dictionary's **V** (value) entry (see Table 220) identifies
the item or items currently selected in the choice field. If the field
does not allow multiple selection---that is, if the MultiSelect flag
*(PDF 1.4)* is not set---or if multiple selection is supported but only
one item is currently selected, **V** is a text string representing the
name of the selected item, as given in the field dictionary's **Opt**
array. If multiple items are selected, **V** is an array of such
strings. (For items represented in the **Opt** array by a two-element
array, the name string is the second of the two array elements.) The
default value of **V** is **null**, indicating that no item is currently
selected.

**12.7.4.5 Signature Fields**

A *signature field (PDF 1.3)* is a form field that contains a digital
signature (see 12.8, "Digital Signatures"). The field dictionary
representing a signature field may contain the additional entries listed
in Table 232, as well as the standard entries described in Table 220.
The field type (**FT**) shall be **Sig**, and the field value (**V**),
if present, shall be a *signature dictionary* containing the signature
and specifying various attributes of the signature field (see Table
252).

NOTE 1 This signature form field serves two primary purposes. The first
is to define the form field that will provide the visual signing
properties for display but it also may hold information needed later
when the actual signing takes place, such as the signature technology to
use. This carries information from the author of the document to the
software that later does the signing.

NOTE 2 Filling in (signing) the signature field entails updating at
least the **V** entry and usually also the **AP** entry of the
associated widget annotation. Exporting a signature field typically
exports the **T**, **V**, and **AP** entries.

Like any other field, a signature field may be described by a widget
annotation dictionary containing entries pertaining to an annotation as
well as a field (see 12.5.6.19, "Widget Annotations"). The annotation
rectangle (**Rect**) in such a dictionary shall give the position of the
field on its page. Signature fields that are not intended to be visible
shall have an annotation rectangle that has zero height and width.
Conforming readers shall treat such signatures as not visible.
Conforming readers shall also treat signatures as not visible if either
the **Hidden** bit or the **NoView** bit of the **F** entry is **true**.
The **F** entry is described in Table 164, and annotation flags are
described in Table 165.

The appearance dictionary (**AP**) of a signature field's widget
annotation defines the field's visual appearance on the page (see
12.5.5, "Appearance Streams").

                          dictionary* that specifies a set of form
                          fields that shall be locked when this
                          signature field is signed. Table 233 lists
                          the entries in this dictionary.

  **SV**     dictionary   *(Optional; shall be an indirect reference;
                          PDF 1.5)* A *seed value dictionary* (see
                          Table 234) containing information that
                          constrains the properties of a signature
                          that is applied to this field.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

The signature field lock dictionary (described in Table 233) contains
field names from the signature seed value dictionary (described in Table
234) that cannot be changed through the user interface of a conforming
reader.

+------------+----------+-------------------------------------------+

The value of the **SV** entry in the field dictionary is a seed value
dictionary whose entries (see Table 234) provide constraining
information that shall be used at the time the signature is applied. Its
**Ff** entry specifies whether the other entries in the dictionary shall
be honoured or whether they are merely recommendations.

The seed value dictionary may include seed values for private entries
belonging to multiple handlers. A given handler shall use only those
entries that are pertinent to itself and ignore the others.

| **DigestMethod** | array    | (*Optional; PDF 1.7*) An array of     |

**12.7.5 Form Actions**

**12.7.5.1 General**

Interactive forms also support special types of actions in addition to
those described in 12.6.4, "Action Types":

- *submit-form action*

- *reset-form action*

- *import-data action*

**12.7.5.2 Submit-Form Action**

Upon invocation of a *submit-form action*, a conforming processor shall
transmit the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a
specified uniform resource locator (URL),

NOTE Presumably, the URL is the address of a Web server that will
process them and send back a response.

The value of the action dictionary's **Flags** entry shall be an
non-negative integer containing flags specifying various characteristics
of the action. Bit positions within the flag word shall be numbered
starting with 1 (low-order). Table 237 shows the meanings of the flags;
all undefined flag bits shall be reserved and shall be set to 0.

The set of fields whose names and values are to be submitted shall be
defined by the **Fields** array in the action dictionary (Table 236)
together with the Include/Exclude and IncludeNoValueFields flags in the
**Flags** entry (Table 237). Each element of the **Fields** array shall
identify an interactive form field, either by an indirect reference to
its field dictionary or *(PDF 1.3)* by its fully qualified field name
(see 12.7.3.2, "Field Names"). If the Include/Exclude flag is clear, the
submission consists of all fields listed in the **Fields** array, along
with any descendants of those fields in the field hierarchy. If the
Include/Exclude flag is set, the submission shall consist of all fields
in the document's interactive form *except* those listed in the
**Fields** array.

and Table 221) takes precedence over the action's **Fields** array and
Include/Exclude flag. Fields whose NoExport flag is set shall not be
included in a submit-form action.

Field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats,
depending on the settings of the action's ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and
XFDF flags (see the Bibliography for references):

- HTML Form format (described in the *HTML 4.01 Specification*)

- Forms Data Format (FDF), which is described in 12.7.7, "Forms Data
  Format."

- XFDF, a version of FDF based on XML. XFDF is described in the Adobe
  technical note *XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0.* XML
  is described in the W3C document *Extensible Markup Language (XML)
  1.1*)

- PDF (in this case, the entire document shall be submitted rather than
  individual fields and values).

The name submitted for each field shall be its fully qualified name (see
12.7.3.2, "Field Names"), and the value shall be specified by the **V**
entry in its field dictionary.

For pushbutton fields submitted in FDF, the value submitted shall be
that of the **AP** entry in the field's widget annotation dictionary. If
the submit-form action dictionary contains no **Fields** entry, such
pushbutton fields shall not be submitted.

Fields with no value (that is, whose field dictionary does not contain a
**V** entry) are ordinarily not included in the submission. The
submit-form action's IncludeNoValueFields flag may override this
behaviour. If this flag is set, such valueless fields shall be included
in the submission by name only, with no associated value.

**12.7.5.3 Reset-Form Action**

Upon invocation of a *reset-form action*, a conforming processor shall
reset selected interactive form fields to their default values; that is,
it shall set the value of the **V** entry in the field dictionary to
that of the **DV** entry (see Table 220). If no default value is defined
for a field, its **V** entry shall be removed. For fields that can have
no value (such as pushbuttons), the action has no effect. Table 238
shows the action dictionary entries specific to this type of action.

The value of the action dictionary's **Flags** entry is a non-negative
containing flags specifying various characteristics of the action. Bit
positions within the flag word shall be numbered starting from 1
(low-order). Only one flag is defined for this type of action. All
undefined flag bits shall be reserved and shall be set to 0.

                                 Table 238) specifies which fields to
                                 reset. (All descendants of the
                                 specified fields in the field
                                 hierarchy are reset as well.) If set,
                                 the **Fields** array indicates which
                                 fields to exclude from resetting;
                                 that is, all fields in the document's

**12.7.5.4 Import-Data Action**

Upon invocation of an *import-data action*, a conforming processor shall
import Forms Data Format (FDF) data into the document's interactive form
from a specified file.

> **Table 240 -- Additional entries specific to an import-data action**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**        **Value**
  --------- --------------- -----------------------------------------
  **S**     name            *(Required)* The type of action that this
                            dictionary describes; shall be
                            **ImportData** for an import-data action.

  **F**     file            *(Required)* The FDF file from which to
            specification   import the data.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.7.6 Named Pages**

The optional **Pages** entry *(PDF 1.3)* in a document's name dictionary
(see 7.7.4, "Name Dictionary") contains a name tree that maps name
strings to individual pages within the document. Naming a page allows it
to be referenced in two different ways:

- An import-data action can add the named page to the document into
  which FDF is being imported, either as a page or as a button
  appearance.

- A script executed by a JavaScript action can add the named page to the
  current document as a regular page.

A named page that is intended to be visible to a user shall be left in
the page tree (see 7.7.3, "Page Tree"), and there shall be a reference
to it in the appropriate leaf node of the name dictionary's **Pages**
tree. If the page is not intended to be displayed by the reader, it
shall be referenced from the name dictionary's **Templates** tree
instead. Such invisible pages shall have an object type of **Template**
rather than **Page** and shall have no **Parent** or **B** entry (see
Table 30).

**12.7.7 Forms Data Format**

**12.7.7.1 General**

This sub-clause describes Forms Data Format (FDF), the file format used
for interactive form data *(PDF 1.2)*. FDF can be used when submitting
form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating it into
the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to
stand-alone files that can be stored, transmitted electronically, and
imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. In addition,
beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF can be used to define a container for
annotations that are separate from the PDF document to which they apply.

FDF is based on PDF; it uses the same syntax and has essentially the
same file structure (7.5, "File Structure"). However, it differs from
PDF in the following ways:

- The cross-reference table (7.5.4, "Cross-Reference Table") is
  optional.

- FDF files shall not be updated (see 7.5.6, "Incremental Updates").
  Objects shall only be of generation 0, and no two objects within an
  FDF file shall have the same object number.

- The document structure is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an
  FDF document consists of only one required object.

- The length of a stream shall not be specified by an indirect object.

FDF uses the MIME content type application / vnd . fdf. On the Windows
and UNIX platforms, FDF files have the extension . fdf; on Mac OS, they
have file type \' FDF \'.

**12.7.7.2 FDF File Structure**

**12.7.7.2.1 General**

An FDF file shall be structured in essentially the same way as a PDF
file but contains only those elements required for the export and import
of interactive form and annotation data. It consists of three required
elements and one optional element (see Figure 65):

- A one-line *header* identifying the version number of the PDF
  specification to which the file conforms

- A *body* containing the objects that make up the content of the file

- An optional *cross-reference table* containing information about the
  indirect objects in the file

- An optional *trailer* giving the location of the cross-reference table
  and of certain special objects within the body of the file

+-----------------------+
| +-------------------+ |
| | Header            | |
| +:=================:+ |
| | Body              | |
| +-------------------+ |
| | > Cross-reference | |
| | > table           | |
| | > (optional)      | |
| +-------------------+ |
| | Trailer           | |
| +-------------------+ |
+=======================+

> **Figure 65 -- FDF file structure**

**12.7.7.2.2 FDF Header**

The first line of an FDF file shall be a *header*, which shall contain

> %FDF-1 . 2

The version number is given by the **Version** entry in the FDF
catalogue dictionary (see 12.7.7.3, "FDF Catalog").

**12.7.7.2.3 FDF Body**

The *body* of an FDF file shall consist of a sequence of indirect
objects representing the file's catalogue (see 12.7.7.3, "FDF Catalog")
and any additional objects that the catalogue references. The objects
are of the same basic types described in 7.5, "File Structure" (other
than the %PDF--n.m and %%EOF comments described in 7.5, "File
Structure") have no semantics. They are not necessarily preserved by
applications that edit PDF files." Just as in PDF, objects in FDF can be
direct or indirect.

**12.7.7.2.4 FDF Trailer**

The *trailer* of an FDF file enables a reader to find significant
objects quickly within the body of the file. The last line of the file
contains only the end-of-file marker, %%EOF. This marker shall be
preceded by the *FDF trailer dictionary*, consisting of the keyword
**trailer** followed by a series of one or more key-value pairs enclosed
in double angle brackets (\<\< ... \>\>) (using LESS-THAN SIGNs (3Ch)
and GREATER-THAN SIGNs (3Eh)). The only required key is **Root**, whose
value is an indirect reference to the file's catalogue dictionary (see
Table 242). The trailer may optionally contain additional entries for
objects that are referenced from within the catalogue.

> **Table 241 -- Entry in the FDF trailer dictionary**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**     **Value**
  ---------- ------------ ------------------------------------------
  **Root**   dictionary   *(Required; shall be an indirect
                          reference)* The **Catalog** object for
                          this FDF file (see 12.7.7.3, "FDF
                          Catalog").

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, the trailer has the overall structure

> trailer
>
> \<\< /Root *c* 0 R *key*~2~ *value*~2~ ...
>
> *key*~n~ *value*~n~
>
> \>\>
>
> %%EOF

where *c* is the object number of the file's catalogue dictionary.

**12.7.7.3 FDF Catalog**

**12.7.7.3.1 General**

The root node of an FDF file's object hierarchy is the **Catalog**
dictionary, located by means of the **Root** entry in the file's trailer
dictionary (see FDF Trailer in 12.7.7.2, "FDF File Structure"). As shown
in Table 241, the only required entry in the catalogue is **FDF**; its
value shall be an *FDF dictionary* (Table 243), which in turn shall
contain references to other objects describing the file's contents. The
catalogue may also contain an optional **Version** entry identifying the
version of the PDF specification to which this FDF file conforms.

> **Table 242 -- Entries in the FDF catalog dictionary**

|             |            | (for example, 1.4) if later than |
|             |            | the version specified in the     |
|             |            | file's header (see FDF Header in |
|             |            | 12.7.7.2, "FDF File Structure"). |
|             |            | If the header specifies a later  |
|             |            | version, or if this entry is     |
|             |            | absent, the document conforms to |
|             |            | the version specified in the     |
|             |            | header.                          |

|             |            | slash character (*/*) when       |
|             |            | written in the FDF file (for     |

Embedded FDF files specified in the FDF dictionary's **EmbeddedFDFs**
entry may be encrypted. Besides the usual entries for an embedded file
stream, the stream dictionary representing such an encrypted FDF file
shall contain the additional entry shown in Table 244 to identify the
revision number of the FDF encryption algorithm used to encrypt the
file. Although the FDF encryption mechanism is separate from the one for
PDF file encryption described in 7.6, "Encryption," revision 1 (the only
one defined) uses a similar RC4 encryption algorithm based on a 40-bit
encryption key. The key shall be computed by means of an MD5 hash, using
a padded user-supplied password as input. The computation shall be
identical to steps (a) and (b) of the \"Algorithm 2: Computing an
encryption key\" in 7.6.3.3, \"Encryption Key Algorithm\"; the first 5
bytes of the result shall be the encryption key for the embedded FDF
file.

The **JavaScript** entry in the FDF dictionary holds a *JavaScript
dictionary* containing JavaScript scripts that shall be defined globally
at the document level, rather than associated with individual fields.
The dictionary may contain scripts defining JavaScript functions for use
by other scripts in the document, as well as scripts that shall be
executed immediately before and after the FDF file is imported. Table
245 shows the contents of this dictionary.

**12.7.7.3.2 FDF Fields**

Each field in an FDF file shall be described by an *FDF field
dictionary*. Table 246 shows the contents of this type of dictionary.
Most of the entries have the same form and meaning as the corresponding
entries in a field dictionary (Table 220, Table 222, Table 229, and
Table 231) or a widget annotation dictionary (Table 168 and Table 188).
Unless otherwise indicated in the table, importing a field causes the
values of the entries in the FDF field dictionary to replace those of
the corresponding entries in the field with the same fully qualified
name in the target document.

                             shall be assumed that the page resides
                             in the associated PDF file.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.7.7.3.4 FDF Annotation Dictionaries**

Each annotation dictionary in an FDF file shall have a **Page** entry
(see Table 251) that shall indicate the page of the source document to
which the annotation is attached.

> **Table 251 -- Additional entry for annotation dictionaries in an FDF
> file**

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**   **Value**
  ---------- ---------- ---------------------------------------
  **Page**   integer    *(Required for annotations in FDF
                        files)* The ordinal page number on
                        which this annotation shall appear,
                        where page 0 is the first page.

  -------------------------------------------------------------

**12.7.8 XFA Forms**

PDF 1.5 introduces support for interactive forms based on the Adobe XML
Forms Architecture (XFA). The **XFA** entry in the interactive forms
dictionary (see Table 218) specifies an *XFA resource*, which shall be
an XML stream that contains the form information. The format of an XFA
resource is described in the *XML Data Package (XDP) Specification* (see
the Bibliography).

The **XFA** entry shall be either a stream containing the entire XFA
resource or an array specifying individual *packets* that together make
up the XFA resource. The resource includes but is not limited to the
following information:

- The *form template* (specified in the template packet), which
  describes the characteristics of the form, including its fields,
  calculations, validations, and formatting. The *XML Template
  Specification* describes the architecture of a form template (see
  Bibliography).

- The *data* (specified in the datasets packet), which represents the
  state of the form

- The *configuration information* (specified in the config packet),
  which shall be used to properly process the form template and
  associated data. Configuration information shall be formatted as
  described in the *XML Configuration Specification* (see Bibliography).

A *packet* is a pair of a string and stream. The string contains the
name of the XML element and the stream contains the complete text of
this XML element. Each packet represents a complete XML element, with
the exception of the first and last packet, which specify begin and end
tags for the xdp:xdp element (see EXAMPLE 1 in this sub-clause).

When an **XFA** entry is present in an interactive form dictionary, the
XFA resource provides information about the form; in particular, all
form-related events such as calculations and validations. The other
entries in the interactive form dictionary shall be consistent with the
information in the XFA resource. When creating or modifying a PDF file
with an XFA resource, a conforming writer shall follow these rules:

- PDF interactive form field objects shall be present for each field
  specified in the XFA resource. The XFA field values shall be
  consistent with the corresponding **V** entries of the PDF field
  objects.

- The *XFA Scripting Object Model (SOM)* specifies a naming convention
  that shall be used to connect interactive form field names with field
  names in the XFA resource. Information about this model is available
  in the *XFA Specification, version 2.5* (see the Bibliography).

- No **A** or **AA** entries (see Table 164) shall be present in the
  annotation dictionaries of fields that also have actions specified by
  the XFA resource.

### 12.8 Digital Signatures

**12.8.1 General**

A digital signature *(PDF 1.3)* may be used to authenticate the identity
of a user and the document's contents. It stores information about the
signer and the state of the document when it was signed. The signature
may be purely mathematical, such as a public/private-key encrypted
document digest, or it may be a biometric form of identification, such
as a handwritten signature, fingerprint, or retinal scan. The specific
form of authentication used shall be implemented by a special software
module called a *signature handler*. Signature handlers shall be
identified in accordance with the rules defined in Annex E.

Digital signatures in ISO 32000 currently support two activities: adding
a digital signature to a document and later checking that signature for
validity. Revocation information is a signed attribute, which means that
the signing software must capture the revocation information before
signing. A similar requirement applies to the chain of certificates. The
signing software must capture and validate the certificate\'s chain
*before* signing.

Signature information shall be contained in a *signature dictionary*,
whose entries are listed in Table 252. Signature handlers may use or
omit those entries that are marked optional in the table but should use
them in a standard way if they are used at all. In addition, signature
handlers may add private entries of their own. To avoid name
duplication, the keys for all such private entries shall be prefixed
with the registered handler name followed by a PERIOD (2Eh).

Signatures shall be created by computing a *digest* of the data (or part
of the data) in a document, and storing the digest in the document. To
verify the signature, the digest shall be re-computed and compared with
the one stored in the document. Differences in the digest values
indicate that modifications have been made since the document was
signed.

There are two defined techniques for computing a digital signature of
the contents of all or part of a PDF file:

- A *byte range digest* shall be computed over a range of bytes in the
  file, that shall be indicated by the **ByteRange** entry in the
  signature dictionary. This range should be the entire file, including
  the signature dictionary but excluding the signature value itself (the
  **Contents** entry). Other ranges may be used but since they do not
  check for all changes to the document, their use is not recommended.
  When a byte range digest is present, all values in the signature
  dictionary shall be direct objects.

- Additionally, modification detection may be specified by a *signature
  reference dictionary*. The **TransformMethod** entry shall specify the
  general method for modification detection, and the **TransformParams**
  entry shall specify the variable portions of the method.

A PDF document may contain the following standard types of signatures:

- One or more approval signatures. These signatures appear in signature
  form fields (see 12.7.4.5, "Signature Fields"). The signature
  dictionary corresponding to each signature shall be the value of the
  form field (as specified by its **V** entry). The signature dictionary
  shall contain a **ByteRange** entry representing a byte range digest,
  as described previously. A signature shall be validated by recomputing
  the digest and comparing it with the one stored in the signature.

NOTE 1 If a signed document is modified and saved by incremental update
(see 7.5.6, "Incremental Updates"), the data corresponding to the byte
range of the original signature is preserved. Therefore, if the
signature is valid, it is possible to recreate the state of the document
as it existed at the time of signing.

- At most one certification signature (*PDF 1.5*). The signature
  dictionary of a certification signature shall be the value of a
  signature field and shall contain a **ByteRange** entry. It may also
  be referenced from the **DocMDP** entry in the permissions dictionary
  (see 12.8.4, "Permissions"). The signature dictionary shall contain a
  signature reference dictionary (see Table 253) that has a **DocMDP**
  transform method. See 12.8.2.2, "DocMDP" for information on how these
  signatures shall be created and validated.

> A signature dictionary for a certification or approval signature may
> also have a signature reference dictionary with a **FieldMDP**
> transform method; see 12.8.2.4, "FieldMDP."

- At most two *usage rights* signatures (*PDF 1.5*). Its signature
  dictionary shall be referenced from the **UR3** (*PDF 1.6*) entry in
  the permissions dictionary, whose entries are listed in Table 258,
  (not from a signature field). The signature dictionary shall contain a
  **Reference** entry whose value is a signature reference dictionary
  that has a **UR** transform method. See 12.8.2.3, "UR" for information
  on how these signatures shall be created and validated.

|               |          | to create the signature. If           |

NOTE 2 The entries in the signature dictionary can be conceptualized as
being in different dictionaries; they are in one dictionary for
historical and cryptographic reasons. The categories are signature
properties (**R**, **M**, **Name**, **Reason**, **Location**,
**Prop_Build**, **Prop_AuthTime**, and **Prop_AuthType**); key
information (**Cert** and portions of **Contents** when the signature
value is a PKCS#7 object); reference (Reference and **ByteRange**); and
signature value (**Contents** when the signature value is a PKCS#1
object).

                                 For security reasons, MD5 should
                                 not be used. It is mentioned for
                                 backwards compatibility, since it
                                 remains the default value.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

**12.8.2 Transform Methods**

**12.8.2.1 General**

Transform methods, along with transform parameters, shall determine
which objects are included and excluded in revision comparison. The
following sub-clauses discuss the types of transform methods, their
transform parameters, and when they shall be used.

**12.8.2.2 DocMDP**

**12.8.2.2.1 General**

The **DocMDP** transform method shall be used to detect modifications
relative to a signature field that is signed by the author of a document
(the person applying the first signature). A document can contain only
one signature field that contains a **DocMDP** transform method; it
shall be the first signed field in the document. It enables the author
to specify what changes shall be permitted to be made the document and
what changes invalidate the author's signature.

NOTE As discussed earlier, "MDP" stands for *modification detection and
prevention*. Certification signatures that use the DocMDP transform
method enable *detection* of disallowed changes specified by the author.
In addition, disallowed changes can also be *prevented* when the
signature dictionary is referred to by the **DocMDP** entry in the
permissions dictionary (see 12.8.4, "Permissions").

A certification signature should have a legal attestation dictionary
(see 12.8.5, "Legal Content Attestations") that specifies all content
that might result in unexpected rendering of the document contents,
along with the author's attestation to such content. This dictionary may
be used to establish an author's intent if the integrity of the document
is questioned.

The **P** entry in the **DocMDP** transform parameters dictionary (see
Table 254) shall indicate the author's specification of which changes to
the document will invalidate the signature. (These changes to the
document shall also be prevented if the signature dictionary is referred
from the **DocMDP** entry in the permissions dictionary.) A value of 1
for **P** indicates that the document shall be final; that is, any
changes shall invalidate the signature. The values 2 and 3 shall permit
modifications that are appropriate for form field or comment workflows.

**12.8.2.2.2 Validating Signatures That Use the DocMDP Transform
Method**

To validate a signature that uses the DocMDP transform method, a
conforming reader first shall verify the byte range digest. Next, it
shall verify that any modifications that have been made to the document
are permitted by the transform parameters.

Once the byte range digest is validated, the portion of the document
specified by the **ByteRange** entry in the signature dictionary (see
Table 252) is known to correspond to the state of the document at the
time of signing.

Therefore, conforming readers may compare the signed and current
versions of the document to see whether there have been modifications to
any objects that are not permitted by the transform parameters.

|          |          | Default value: **1.2**.                   |
+----------+----------+-------------------------------------------+

**12.8.2.3 UR**

The **UR** transform method shall be used to detect changes to a
document that shall invalidate a *usage rights* signature, which is
referred to from the **UR3** entry in the permissions dictionary (see
12.8.4, "Permissions"). Usage rights signatures shall be used to enable
additional interactive features that may not available by default in a
conforming reader. The signature shall be used to validate that the
permissions have been granted by a bonafide granting authority. The
transform parameters dictionary (see Table 255) specifies the additional
rights that shall be enabled if the signature is valid. If the signature
is invalid because the document has been modified in a way that is not
permitted or the identity of the signer is not granted the extended
permissions, additional rights shall not be granted.

EXAMPLE Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features
in Adobe Reader, using public-key cryptography. It uses certificate
authorities to issue public key certificates to document creators with
which it has entered into a business relationship. Adobe Reader verifies
that the rights-enabling signature uses a certificate from an
Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Other conforming readers are
free to use this same mechanism for their own purposes.

**UR3** (*PDF 1.6*): The **ByteRange** entry in the signature dictionary
(see Table 252) shall be present. First, a conforming reader shall
verify the byte range digest to determine whether the portion of the
document specified by **ByteRange** corresponds to the state of the
document at the time of signing. Next, a conforming reader shall examine
the current version of the document to see whether there have been
modifications to any objects that are not permitted by the transform
parameters.

+---------+----------+-------------------------------------------+

On behalf of a document author creating a document containing both form
fields and signatures the following shall be supported by conforming
writers:

- The author specifies that form fields shall be filled in without
  invalidating the approval or certification signature. The **P** entry
  of the **DocMDP** transform parameters dictionary shall be set to
  either 2 or 3 (see Table 254).

- The author can also specify that after a specific recipient has signed
  the document, any modifications to specific form fields shall
  invalidate that recipient's signature. There shall be a separate
  signature field for each designated recipient, each having an
  associated signature field lock dictionary (see Table 233) specifying
  the form fields that shall be locked for that user.

- When the recipient signs the field, the signature, signature
  reference, and transform parameters dictionaries shall be created. The
  **Action** and **Fields** entries in the transform parameters
  dictionary shall be copied from the corresponding fields in the
  signature field lock dictionary.

NOTE This copying is done because all objects in a signature dictionary
must be direct objects if the dictionary contains a byte range
signature. Therefore, the transform parameters dictionary cannot
reference the signature field lock dictionary indirectly.

**FieldMDP** signatures shall be validated in a similar manner to
**DocMDP** signatures. See Validating Signatures That Use the DocMDP
Transform Method in 12.8.2.2, "DocMDP" for details.

**12.8.3 Signature Interoperability**

**12.8.3.1 General**

It is intended that conforming readers allow interoperability between
signature handlers; that is, a PDF file signed with a handler from one
vendor shall be able to be validated with a handler from a different
vendor.

If present, the **SubFilter** entry in the signature dictionary shall
specify the encoding of the signature value and key information, while
the **Filter** entry shall specify the preferred handler that should be
used to validate the signature. When handlers are being registered
according to Annex E they shall specify the SubFilter encodings they
support enabling handlers other than the preferred handler to validate
the signatures that the preferred handler creates.

There are several defined values for the **SubFilter** entry, all based
on public-key cryptographic standards published by RSA Security and also
as part of the standards issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) working group; see the
Bibliography for references.

**12.8.3.2 PKCS#1 Signatures**

The PKCS#1 standard supports several public-key cryptographic algorithms
and digest methods, including RSA encryption, DSA signatures, and SHA-1
and MD5 digests (see the Bibliography for references). For signing PDF
files using PKCS#1, the only value of SubFilter that should be used is
adbe.x509.rsa_sha1, which uses the RSA encryption algorithm and SHA-1
digest method. The certificate chain of the signer shall be stored in
the **Cert** entry.

**12.8.3.3 PKCS#7 Signatures as used in ISO 32000**

**12.8.3.3.1 General**

When PKCS#7 signatures are used, the value of **Contents** shall be a
DER-encoded PKCS#7 binary data object containing the signature. The
PKCS#7 object shall conform to RFC3852 Cryptographic Message Syntax.
Different subfilters may be used and shall be registered in accordance
with Annex E. **SubFilter** shall take one of the following values:

- **adbe.pkcs7.detached**: The original signed message digest over the
  document's byte range shall be incorporated as the normal PKCS#7
  SignedData field. No data shall be encapsulated in the PKCS#7
  SignedData field.

- **adbe.pkcs7.sha1**: The SHA1 digest of the document's byte range
  shall be encapsulated in the PKCS#7 SignedData field with ContentInfo
  of type Data. The digest of that SignedData shall be incorporated as
  the normal PKCS#7 digest.

The PKCS#7 object shall conform to the PKCS#7 specification in Internet
RFC 2315, *PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax, Version 1.5* (see the
Bibliography). At minimum, it shall include the signer's X.509 signing
certificate. This certificate shall be used to verify the signature
value in **Contents**.

The PKCS#7 object should contain the following:

- Time stamp information as an unsigned attribute *(PDF 1.6)*: The
  timestamp token shall conform to RFC 3161 and shall be computed and
  embedded into the PKCS#7 object as described in Appendix A of
  RFC 3161. The specific treatment of timestamps and their processing is
  left to the particular signature handlers to define.

- Revocation information as an signed attribute *(PDF 1.6)*: This
  attribute may include all the revocation information that is necessary
  to carry out revocation checks for the signer\'s certificate and its
  issuer certificates. Since revocation information is a signed
  attribute, it must be obtained before the computation of the digital
  signature. This means that the software used by the signer must be
  able to construct the certification path and the associated revocation
  information. If one of the elements cannot be obtained (e.g. no
  connection is possible), a signature with this attribute will not be
  possible.

- *(PDF 1.6)*. This differs from the treatment when using
  *adbe.x509.rsa_sha1* when the certificates shall be placed in the
  **Cert** key of the signature dictionary as defined in Table 252.

- One or more RFC 3281 attribute certificates associated with the signer
  certificate *(PDF 1.7)*. The specific treatment of attribute
  certificates and their processing is left to the particular signature
  handlers to define.

NOTE For maximum compatibility with earlier versions, conforming writers
should follow this practice.

The policy of how to establish trusted identity lists to validate
embedded certificates is up to the validation signature handler.

**12.8.3.3.2 Revocation Information**

The adbe Revocation Information attribute:

> adbe-revocationInfoArchival OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
>
> { adbe(1.2.840.113583) acrobat(1) security(1) 8 }

The value of the revocation information attribute can include any of the
following data types:

- Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), described in RFC 3280 (see the
  Bibliography): CRLs are generally large and therefore should not be
  embedded in the PKCS#7 object.

- Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Responses, described in RFC
  2560, *X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure Online Certificate
  Status Protocol---OCSP* (see the Bibliography): These are generally
  small and constant in size and should be the data type included in the
  PKCS#7 object.

- Custom revocation information: The format is not prescribed by this
  specification, other than that it be encoded as an OCTET STRING. The
  application should be able to determine the type of data contained
  within the OCTET STRING by looking at the associated OBJECT
  IDENTIFIER.

adbe\'s Revocation Information attribute value has ASN.1 type
RevocationInfoArchival:

> RevocationInfoArchival ::= SEQUENCE { crl \[0\] EXPLICIT SEQUENCE of
> CRLs, OPTIONAL ocsp \[1\] EXPLICIT SEQUENCE of OCSP Responses,
> OPTIONAL otherRevInfo \[2\] EXPLICIT SEQUENCE of OtherRevInfo,
> OPTIONAL
>
> }
>
> OtherRevInfo ::= SEQUENCE { Type OBJECT IDENTIFIER
>
> Value OCTET STRING
>
> }

For byte range signatures, **Contents** shall be a hexadecimal string
with "\<" and "\>" delimiters. It shall fit precisely in the space
between the ranges specified by **ByteRange**. Since the length of
PKCS#7 objects is not entirely predictable, the value of **Contents**
shall be padded with zeros at the end of the string (before the "\>"
delimiter) before writing the PKCS#7 to the allocated space in the file.

The format for encoding signature values should be
**adbe.pkcs7.detached**. This encoding allows the most options in terms
of algorithm use. The following table shows the algorithms supported for
the various **SubFilter** values.

**12.8.4 Permissions**

The **Perms** entry in the document catalogue (see Table 28) shall
specify a *permissions dictionary (PDF 1.5)*. Each entry in this
dictionary (see Table 258 for the currently defined entries) shall
specify the name of a permission handler that controls access
permissions for the document. These permissions are similar to those
defined by security handlers (see Table 22) but do not require that the
document be encrypted. For a permission to be actually granted for a
document, it shall be allowed by each permission handler that is present
in the permissions dictionary as well as by the security handler.

NOTE An example of a permission is the ability to fill in a form field.

|            |            | For example, A conforming reader does    |
|            |            | not permit saving documents by default,  |

|            |            | enable saving specific documents. The    |
|            |            | signature shall be used to validate that |
|            |            | the permissions have been granted by the |
|            |            | agent that did the signing.              |

|            |            | The signature dictionary shall contain a |

|            |            | signature reference dictionary that has  |
|            |            | a **UR** transform method (see 12.8.2.3, |
|            |            | "UR"). The transform parameter           |
|            |            | dictionary for this method indicates     |
|            |            | which additional permissions shall be    |
|            |            | granted for the document. If the         |

|            |            | reader shall allow the specified         |
|            |            | permissions for the document, in         |
|            |            | addition to the application's default    |

**12.8.5 Legal Content Attestations**

The PDF language provides a number of capabilities that can make the
rendered appearance of a PDF document vary. These capabilities could
potentially be used to construct a document that misleads the recipient
of a document, intentionally or unintentionally. These situations are
relevant when considering the legal implications of a signed PDF
document.

Therefore, a mechanism shall be provided by which a document recipient
can determine whether the document can be trusted. The primary method is
to accept only documents that contain certification signatures (one that
has a **DocMDP** signature that defines what shall be permitted to
change in a document; see 12.8.2.2, "DocMDP").

When creating certification signatures, conforming writers should also
create a *legal attestation dictionary*, whose entries are shown in
Table 259. This dictionary shall be the value of the **Legal** entry in
the document catalogue (see Table 28). Its entries shall specify all
content that may result in unexpected rendering of the document
contents. The author may provide further clarification of such content
by means of the **Attestation** entry. Reviewers should establish for
themselves that they trust the author and contents of the document. In
the case of a legal challenge to the document, any questionable content
can be reviewed in the context of the information in this dictionary.

###  12.9 Measurement Properties

PDF documents, such as those created by CAD software, may contain
graphics that are intended to represent real-world objects. Users of
such documents often require information about the scale and units of
measurement of the corresponding real-world objects and their
relationship to units in PDF user space.

This information enables users of conforming readers to perform
measurements that yield results in the units intended by the creator of
the document. A measurement in this context is the result of a canonical
function that takes as input a set of *n* coordinate pairs

> {(x0, y0), ..., (xn -- 1, yn -- 1)}

and produces a single number as output depending on the type of
measurement. For example, distance measurement is equivalent to

> n -- 2
>
> ∑ (xi -- xi + 1)2 + (yi -- yi 1) i = 0

for n ≥ 2.

Beginning with PDF 1.6, such information may be stored in a *measure
dictionary* (see Table 261). Measure dictionaries provide information
about measurement units associated with a rectangular area of the
document known as a *viewport*.

A viewport *(PDF 1.6)* is a rectangular region of a page. The optional
**VP** entry in a page dictionary (see Table 30) shall specify an array
of viewport dictionaries, whose entries shall be as shown in Table 260.
Viewports allow different measurement scales (specified by the
**Measure** entry) to be used in different areas of a page, if
necessary.

The dictionaries in the **VP** array shall be in drawing order. Since
viewports might overlap, to determine the viewport to use for any point
on a page, the dictionaries in the array shall be examined, starting
with the last one and iterating in reverse, and the first one whose
**BBox** entry contains the point shall be chosen.

NOTE 1 Any measurement that potentially involves multiple viewports,
such as one specifying the distance between two points, shall use the
information specified in the viewport of the first point.

  **Name**      text string  *(Optional)* A descriptive text string or
                             title of the viewport, intended for use in
                             a user interface.

  **Measure**   dictionary   *(Optional)* A measure dictionary (see
                             Table 261) that specifies the scale and
                             units that shall apply to measurements
                             taken on the contents within the viewport.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A measure dictionary shall specify an alternate coordinate system for a
region of a page. Along with the viewport dictionary, it shall provide
the information needed to convert coordinates in the page's coordinate
system to coordinates in the measuring coordinate system. The measure
dictionary shall provide information for formatting the resulting values
into textual form for presentation in a graphical user interface.

Table 261 shows the entries in a measure dictionary. PDF 1.6 defines
only a single type of coordinate system, a *rectilinear* coordinate
system, that shall be specified by the value **RL** for the **Subtype**
entry, which is defined as one in which the *x* and *y* axes are
perpendicular and have units that increment linearly (to the right and
up, respectively). Other subtypes may be used, providing the flexibility
to measure using other types of coordinate systems.

| **Type**    | name     | *(Optional)* The type of PDF object that |
|             |          | this dictionary describes; shall be      |
|             |          | **Measure** for a measure dictionary.    |
+-------------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **Subtype** | name     | *(Optional)* A name specifying the type  |
|             |          | of coordinate system to use for          |
|             |          | measuring.                               |
|             |          |                                          |
|             |          | Default value: **RL**, which specifies a |
|             |          | rectilinear coordinate system            |
+-------------+----------+------------------------------------------+

Table 262 shows the additional entries in a rectilinear measure
dictionary. Many of the entries in this dictionary shall be *number
format arrays*, which are arrays of *number format dictionaries* (see
Table 263). Each number format dictionary shall represent a specific
unit of measurement (such as miles or feet). It shall contain
information about how each unit shall be expressed in text and factors
for calculating the number of units.

Number format arrays specify all the units that shall be used when
expressing a specific measurement. Each array shall contain one or more
number format dictionaries, in descending order of granularity. If one
unit of measurement X is larger than one unit of measurement Y then X
has a larger order of granularity than Y. All the elements in the array
shall contain text strings that, concatenated together, specify how the
units shall be displayed.

NOTE 2 For example, a measurement of 1.4505 miles might be expressed as
"1.4505 mi", which would require one number format dictionary for miles,
or as "1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in", which would require three dictionaries
(for miles, feet, and inches).

EXAMPLE 1 A number format dictionary specifying feet should precede one
specifying inches.

To use a number format array to create a text string containing the
appropriately formatted units for display in a user interface, apply the
following algorithm:

> **Algorithm: Use of a number format array to create a formatted text
> string**

a)  The entry in the rectilinear measure dictionary (see Table 262) that
    references the number format array determines the meaning of the
    initial measurement value. For example, the **X** entry specifies
    user space units, and the **T** entry specifies degrees.

b)  Multiply the value specified previously by the **C** entry of the
    first number format dictionary in the array, which converts the
    measurement to units of the largest granularity specified in the
    array. Apply the value of **RT** as appropriate.

c)  If the result contains no nonzero fractional portion, concatenate
    the label specified by the **U** entry in the order specified by
    **O**, after adding spacing from **PS** and **SS**. The formatting
    is then complete.

d)  If there is a nonzero fractional portion and no more elements in the
    array, format the fractional portion as specified by the **RD**,
    **F**, **D**, and **FD** entries of the last dictionary. Concatenate
    the label specified by the **U** entry in the order specified by
    **O**, after adding spacing from **PS** and **SS**. The formatting
    is then complete.

e)  If there is a nonzero fractional portion and more elements in the
    array, proceed to the next number format dictionary in the array.
    Multiply its **C** entry by the fractional result from the previous
    step. Apply the value of **RT** as appropriate. Then proceed to step
    3.

The concatenation of elements in this process assumes left-to-right
order. Documents using right-to-left languages may modify the process
and the meaning of the entries as appropriate to produce the correct
results.

EXAMPLE 2 The following example shows a measure dictionary that
specifies that changes in *x* or *y* are expressed in miles; distances
are expressed in miles, feet, and inches; and area is expressed in
acres. Given a sample distance in scaled units of 1.4505 miles, the
formatted text produced by applying the number format array would be

> "1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in".

### 12.10 Document Requirements 

**12.10.1 General**

Beginning with PDF 1.7, a document may specify requirements that shall
be present in a conforming reader in order for the document to function
properly. The **Requirements** entry in the document catalogue (see
7.7.2, "Document Catalog") shall specify an array of *requirement
dictionaries*, whose entries are shown in Table 264.

> **Table 264 -- Entries common to all requirement dictionaries**

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**         **Type**   **Description**
  --------------- ---------- ----------------------------------
  **Type**        name       *(Optional)* The type of PDF
                             object that this dictionary
                             describes. If present, shall be
                             **Requirement** for a requirement
                             dictionary.

  **S**           name       *(Required)* The type of
                             requirement that this dictionary
                             describes. The value shall be
                             **EnableJavaScripts**.

  **RH**          array      *(Optional)* An array of
                             *requirement handler dictionaries*
                             (see Table 265). This array lists
                             the requirement handlers that
                             shall be disabled (not executed)
                             if the conforming reader can check
                             the requirement specified in the
                             **S** entry.
  -------------------------------------------------------------

The **RH** entry ensures backward-capability for this feature. Some PDF
documents include JavaScript segments that verify compliance with
certain requirements. Such JavaScript segments are called *requirement
handlers*. Backward-compatibility shall be achieved by ensuring that
either the conforming reader checks the requirement or the JavaScript
segment checks the requirement, but not both.

When a PDF document is first opened, all JavaScript segments in the
document shall be executed, including the requirement handlers. If the
conforming reader understands the requirement dictionary, it shall
disable execution of the requirement handlers named by the **RH** entry.
If the requirement handler is in JavaScript, the conforming reader shall
look up the segment using the **Names** dictionary (7.7.4, "Name
Dictionary").

In PDF 1.7, the only defined requirement type shall be
**EnableJavaScripts**. This requirement indicates that the document
requires JavaScript execution to be enabled in the conforming reader. If
the **EnableJavaScripts** requirement is present, an interactive
conforming reader may allow the user to choose between keeping
JavaScript execution disabled or temporarily enabling it to benefit from
the full function of the document.

If the **EnableJavaScripts** requirement is present in a requirement
dictionary, the inclusion of the **RH** entry that specifies a
JavaScript segment would be pointless. Writing a JavaScript segment to
verify that JavaScript is enabled would not achieve the desired goal.
The **RH** entry shall not be used in PDF 1.7.

**12.10.2 Requirement Handlers**

A requirement handler is a program that verifies certain requirements
are satisfied. Table 265 describes the entries in a requirement handler
dictionary.

|              |          | conforming readers to ignore     |

|              |          | Dictionary"). If the conforming  |

## 13 Multimedia Features

### 13.1 General

This clause describes those features of PDF that support embedding and
playing multimedia content. It contains the following sub-clauses:

- 13.2, "Multimedia," describes the comprehensive set of multimedia
  capabilities that were introduced in PDF 1.5.

- 13.3, "Sounds," and 13.4, "Movies," describe features that have been
  supported since PDF 1.2.

- 13.5, "Alternate Presentations," describes a slideshow capability that
  was introduced in PDF 1.4.

- 13.6, "3D Artwork," describes the capability of embedding
  three-dimensional graphics in a document, introduced in PDF 1.6.

### 13.2 Multimedia

**13.2.1 General**

PDF 1.5 introduces a comprehensive set of language constructs to enable
the following capabilities:

- Arbitrary media types may be embedded in PDF files.

- Embedded media, as well as referenced media outside a PDF file, may be
  played with a variety of player software. (In some situations, the
  player software may be the conforming reader itself.)

NOTE 1 The term playing is used with a wide variety of media, and is not
restricted to audio or video. For example, it may be applied to static
images such as JPEGs.

- Media objects may have multiple *renditions*, which may be chosen at
  play-time based on considerations such as available bandwidth.

- Document authors may control play-time requirements, such as which
  player software should be used to play a given media object.

- Media objects may be played in various ways; for example, in a
  floating window as well as in a region on a page.

- Future extensions to the media constructs may be handled in an
  appropriate manner by current conforming readers. Authors may control
  how old conforming readers treat future extensions.

- Document authors may adapt the use of multimedia to accessibility
  requirements.

- On-line media objects may be played efficiently, even when very large.

The following list summarizes the multimedia features and indicates
where each feature is discussed:

- 13.2.2, "Viability," describes the rules for determining when media
  objects are suitable for playing on a particular system.

- Rendition actions (see 12.6.4.13, "Rendition Actions") shall be used
  to begin the playing of multimedia content.

- A rendition action associates a screen annotation (see 12.5.6.18,
  "Screen Annotations") with a rendition (see 13.2.3, "Renditions").

- Renditions are of two varieties: media renditions (see 13.2.3.2,
  "Media Renditions") that define the characteristics of the media to be
  played, and selector renditions (see 13.2.3.3, "Selector Renditions")
  that enables choosing which of a set of media renditions should be
  played.

- Media renditions contain entries that specify what should be played
  (see 13.2.4, "Media Clip Objects"), how it should be played (see
  13.2.5, "Media Play Parameters"), and where it should be played (see
  13.2.6, "Media Screen Parameters").

- 13.2.7, "Other Multimedia Objects," describes several PDF objects that
  are referenced by the preceding major objects.

NOTE 2 Some of the features described in the following sub-clauses have
references to corresponding elements in the *Synchronized Multimedia
Integration Language (SMIL 2.0) standard (see the Bibliography).*

**13.2.2 Viability**

When playing multimedia content, the conforming reader shall often make
decisions such as which player software and which options, such as
volume and duration, to use.

In making these decisions, the viewer shall determine the *viability* of
the objects used. If an object is considered non-viable, the media
should not be played. If the object is viable, the media should be
played, though possibly under less than optimum conditions.

There are several entries in the multimedia object dictionaries whose
values shall have an effect on viability. In particular, some of the
object dictionaries define two entries that divide options into one of
two categories:

- **MH** *("must honour")*: The options specified by this entry shall be
  honoured; otherwise, the containing object shall be considered
  non-viable.

- **BE** *("best effort*"): An attempt should be made to honour the
  options; however, if they cannot be honoured, the containing object is
  still considered viable.

**MH** and **BE** are both dictionaries, and the same entries shall be
defined for both of them. In any dictionary where these entries are
allowed, both entries may be present, or only one, or neither.

EXAMPLE The media play parameters dictionary (see Table 279) allows the
playback volume to be set by means of the **V** entry in its **MH** and
**BE** dictionaries (see Table 280).

If the specified volume cannot be honoured, the object shall be
considered non-viable if **V** is in the **MH** dictionary, and playback
shall not occur. If **V** is in the **BE** dictionary (and not also in
the **MH** dictionary), playback should still occur: the playing
software attempts to honour the specified option as best it can.

Using this mechanism, authors may specify minimum requirements (**MH**)
and preferred options (**BE**). They may also specify how entries that
are added in the future to the multimedia dictionaries shall be
interpreted by old conforming readers. If an entry that is unrecognized
by the viewer is in the **MH** dictionary, the object shall be
considered non-viable. If an unrecognized entry is in a **BE**
dictionary, the entry shall be ignored and viability shall be
unaffected. Unless otherwise stated, an object shall be considered
non-viable if its **MH** dictionary contains an unrecognized key or an
unrecognized value for a recognized key.

The following rules apply to the entries in **MH** and **BE**
dictionaries, which behave somewhat differently from other PDF
dictionaries:

- If an entry is required, the requirement is met if the entry is
  present in either the **MH** dictionary or the **BE** dictionary.

- If an optional entry is not present in either dictionary, it shall be
  considered to be present with its default value (if one is defined) in
  the **BE** dictionary.

- If an instance of the same entry is present in both **MH** and **BE**,
  the instance in the **BE** dictionary shall be ignored unless
  otherwise specified.

- If the value of an entry in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary is a
  dictionary or array, it shall be treated as an atomic unit when
  determining viability. That is, all entries within the dictionary or
  array shall be honoured for the containing object to be viable.

NOTE When determining whether entries can be honoured, it is not
required that each one be evaluated independently, since they may be
dependent on one another. That is, a conforming reader or player may
examine multiple entries at once (even within different dictionaries) to
determine whether their values can be honoured.

The following media objects may have **MH** and **BE** dictionaries.
They function as described previously, except where noted in the
individual sub-clauses:

- Rendition (Table 267)

- Media clip data (Table 276)

- Media clip section (Table 278)

- Media play parameters (Table 280)

- Media screen parameters (Table 283)

**13.2.3 Renditions**

> **13.2.3.1 General**

There are two types of *rendition* objects:

- A *media rendition* (see 13.2.3.2, "Media Renditions") is a basic
  media object that specifies what to play, how to play it, and where to
  play it.

- A *selector rendition* (see 13.2.3.3, "Selector Renditions") contains
  an ordered list of renditions. This list may include other selector
  renditions, resulting in a tree whose leaves are media renditions. The
  conforming reader should play the first viable media rendition it
  encounters in the tree (see 13.2.2,

> "Viability").

NOTE 1 Table 266 shows the entries common to all rendition dictionaries.
The N entry in a rendition dictionary specifies a name that can be used
to access the rendition object by means of name tree lookup (see Table
31). JavaScript actions (see 12.6.4.16, "JavaScript Actions"), for
example, use this mechanism.

Since the values referenced by name trees shall be indirect objects, all
rendition objects should be indirect objects.

NOTE 2 A rendition dictionary is not required to have a name tree entry.
When it does, the conforming reader should ensure that the name
specified in the tree is kept the same as the value of the ***N*** entry
(for example, if the user interface allows the name to be changed). A
document should not contain multiple renditions with the same name.

The **MH** and **BE** entries are dictionaries whose entries may be
present in one or the other of them, as described in 13.2.2,
"Viability." For renditions, these dictionaries shall have a single
entry **C** (see Table 267), whose value shall have a *media criteria
dictionary* specifying a set of criteria that shall be met for the
rendition to be considered viable (see Table 268).

The media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other
**MH**/**BE** entries, as they are described in 13.2.2, "Viability." The
criteria specified by all of its entries shall be met regardless of
whether they are in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary. The only exception
is that if an entry in a **BE** dictionary is *unrecognized* by the
conforming reader, it shall not affect the viability of the object. If a
media criteria dictionary is present in both **MH** and **BE**, the
entries in both dictionaries shall be individually evaluated, with
**MH** taking precedence (corresponding **BE** entries shall be
ignored).

                          rendition. The rendition shall be
                          considered non-viable if the conforming

                          use in a user interface and for name tree
                          lookup by JavaScript actions.

  **MH**     dictionary   *(Optional)* A dictionary whose entries
                          (see Table 267) shall be honoured for the

> **13.2.3.2 Media Renditions**

Table 271 lists the entries in a media rendition dictionary. Its entries
specify what media should be played (**C**), how (**P**), and where
(**SP**) it should be played. A media rendition object shall be viable
if and only if the objects referenced by its **C**, **P**, and **SP**
entries are viable.

**C** may be omitted only in cases where a referenced player takes no
meaningful input. This requires that **P** shall be present and that its
referenced media play parameters dictionary (see Table 279) shall
contain a **PL** entry, whose referenced media players dictionary (see
13.2.7.2, "Media Players Dictionary") has a non-empty **MU** array or a
non-empty **A** array.

> **13.2.3.3 Selector Renditions**

A *selector rendition dictionary* shall specify an array of rendition
objects in its **R** entry (see Table 272). The renditions in this array
should be ordered by preference, with the most preferred rendition
first. At play-time, the renditions in the array shall be evaluated and
the first viable media rendition, if any, shall be played. If one of the
renditions is itself a selector, that selector shall be evaluated in
turn, yielding the equivalent of a depth-first tree search. A selector
rendition itself may be non-viable; in this case, none of its associated
media renditions shall be evaluated (in effect, this branch of the tree
is skipped).

NOTE This mechanism may be used, for example, to specify that a large
video clip should be used on highbandwidth machines and a smaller clip
should be used on low-bandwidth machines.

                       object found in the array, or nested
                       within a selector rendition in the array,
                       should be used. An empty array is legal.

**13.2.4 Media Clip Objects**

> **13.2.4.1 General**

There are two types of media clip objects, determined by the subtype
**S**, which can be either **MCD** for media clip data (see 13.2.4.2,
"Media Clip Data") or **MCS** for media clip section (see 13.2.4.3,
"Media Clip Section"). The entries common to all media clip dictionaries
are listed in Table 273.

                        clip section (see 13.2.4.3, "Media Clip
                        Section"). The media clip shall be
                        considered non-viable if the conforming
                        reader does not recognize the value of
                        this entry.

  **N**      text       *(Optional)* The name of the media clip,
             string     for use in the user interface.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

> **13.2.4.2 Media Clip Data**

A *media clip data dictionary* defines the data for a media object that
can be played. Its entries are listed in Table 274

NOTE 1 It may reference a URL to a streaming video presentation or a
movie embedded in the PDF file.

+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| **MH**  | dictionary | *(Optional)* A dictionary whose entries  |
|         |            | (see Table 276) shall be honoured for    |
|         |            | the media clip data to be considered     |
|         |            | viable.                                  |
+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| **BE**  | dictionary | *(Optional)* A dictionary whose entries  |
|         |            | (see Table 276) should only be honoured  |
|         |            | in a "best effort" sense.                |
+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+

The media clip data object shall be considered non-viable if the object
referenced by the **D** entry does not contain a **Type** entry, the
**Type** entry is unrecognized, or the referenced object is not a
dictionary or stream.

This shall effectively exclude the use of simple file specifications
(see 7.11, "File Specifications").

If **D** references a file specification that has an embedded file
stream (see 7.11.4, "Embedded File Streams"), the embedded file stream's
**Subtype** entry shall be ignored if present, and the media clip data
dictionary's **CT** entry shall identify the type of data.

If **D** references a form XObject, the associated player is implicitly
the conforming reader, and the form XObject shall be rendered as if it
were any other data type.

NOTE 2 The **F** and **D** entries in the media play parameters
dictionary (see Table 279) should apply to a form XObject just as they
do to a QuickTime movie.

For media other than form XObjects, the media clip object shall provide
enough information to allow a conforming reader to locate an appropriate
player. This may be done by providing one or both of the following
entries, the first being the preferred method:

- A **CT** entry that specifies the content type of the media. If this
  entry is present, any player that is selected shall support this
  content type.

- A **PL** entry that specifies one or more players that may be used to
  play the referenced media. if **CT** is present, there should also be
  a **PL** present.

The **P** entry specifies a *media permissions dictionary* (see Table
275) specifying the manner in which the data referenced by the media may
be used by a conforming reader. These permissions allow authors control
over how their data is exposed to operations that could allow it to be
copied. If the dictionary contains unrecognized entries or entries with
unrecognized values, it shall be considered non-viable, and the
conforming reader shall not play the media.

+----------+----------+------------------------------------------+

The **BU** entry in the media clip data **MH** and **BE** dictionaries
(see Table 276) specifies a base URL for the media data. Relative URLs
in the media (which point to auxiliary files or are used for
hyperlinking) should be resolved with respect to the value of **BU**.
The following are additional requirements concerning the **BU** entry:

- If **BU** is in the **MH** dictionary and the base URL is not honoured
  the media clip data shall be non-viable.

NOTE 3 An example of this is that the player does not accept base URLs.

- Determining the viability of the object shall not require checking
  whether the base URL is valid

NOTE 4 The target host exists.

- Absolute URls within the media shall not be affected.

- If the media itself contains a base URL, that value shall be used in
  preference to **BU**.

NOTE 5 An example of this is that the \<BASE\> element is defined in
HTML.

- **BU** is completely independent of and unrelated to the value of the
  **URI** entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2, "Document
  Catalog").

- If **BU** is not present and the media is embedded within the
  document, the URL to the PDF file itself shall be used as if it were
  the value of a **BU** entry in the **BE** dictionary; that is, as an
  implicit best-effort base URL. **Table 276 -- Entries in a media clip

> **13.2.4.3 Media Clip Section**

A *media clip section* dictionary (see Table 277) defines a continuous
section of another media clip object (known as the *next-level* media
clip object). The next-level media clip object, specified by the **D**
entry, may be either a media clip data object or another media clip
section object. However, the linked list formed by the **D** entries of
media clip sections shall terminate in a media clip data object. If the
next-level media object is nonviable, the media clip section shall be
also non-viable.

NOTE 1 A media clip section could define a 15-minute segment of a media
clip data object representing a two-hour movie.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**     **Value**
  --------- ------------ ------------------------------------------
  **D**     dictionary   *(Required)* The media clip section or
                         media clip data object (the next-level
                         media object) of which this media clip
                         section object defines a continuous
                         section.

  **Alt**   array        *(Optional)* An array that provides
                         alternate text descriptions for the media
                         clip section in case it cannot be played;
                         see 14.9.2.4, "Multi-language Text
                         Arrays."

  **MH**    dictionary   *(Optional)* A dictionary whose entries
                         (see Table 278) shall be honoured for the
                         media clip section to be considered
                         viable.

  **BE**    dictionary   *(Optional)* A dictionary whose entries
                         (see Table 278) shall only be honoured in
                         a "best effort" sense.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

The **B** and **E** entries in the media clip section's **MH** and
**BE** dictionaries (see Table 278) shall define a subsection of the
next-level media object referenced by **D** by specifying beginning and
ending offsets into it. Depending on the media type, the offsets may be
specified by time, frames, or markers (see 13.2.6.2, "Media Offset
Dictionary"). **B** and **E** are not required to specify the same type
of offset.

The following rules apply to these offsets:

- For media types where an offset makes no sense (such as JPEG images),
  **B** and **E** shall be ignored, with no effect on viability.

- When **B** or **E** are specified by time or frames, their value shall
  be considered to be relative to the start of the next-level media
  clip. However, if **E** specifies an offset beyond the end of the
  next-level media clip, the end value shall be used instead, and there
  is no effect on viability.

- When **B** or **E** are specified by markers, there shall be a
  corresponding absolute offset into the underlying media clip data
  object. If this offset is not within the range defined by the
  next-level media clip (if any), or if the marker is not present in the
  underlying media clip, the existence of the entry shall be ignored,
  and there is no effect on viability.

- If the absolute offset derived from the values of all **B** entries in
  a media clip section chain is greater than or equal to the absolute
  offset derived from the values of all **E** entries, an empty range
  shall be defined. An empty range is legal.

- Any **B** or **E** entry in a media clip section's **MH** dictionary
  shall be honoured at play-time in order for the media clip section to
  be considered viable.

NOTE 2 The entry may not be honored if its value was not viable or if
the player did not support its value; for example, the player did not
support markers.

- If a **B** or **E** entry is in a media clip section's **MH**
  dictionary, all **B** or **E** entries, respectively, at deeper levels
  (closer to the media clip data), shall be evaluated as if they were in
  an **MH** dictionary (even if they are actually within **BE**
  dictionaries).

- If **B** or **E** entry in a **BE** dictionary cannot be supported, it
  may be ignored at play-time.

|         |            | NOTE 6 Similar to SMIL's *repeatCount*   |
|         |            | attribute. Zero means repeat forever.    |

+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+

The value of the **D** entry is a *media duration dictionary*, whose
entries are shown in Table 281. It specifies a temporal duration.

NOTE 1 The D entry dictionary temporal duration corresponds to the
notion of a simple duration in SMIL.

The duration may be a specific amount of time, it may be infinity, or it
may be the media's *intrinsic duration.*

EXAMPLE The intrinsic duration of a two-hour QuickTime movie is two
hours.

The intrinsic duration may be modified when a media clip section (see
13.2.4.3, "Media Clip Section") is used: the intrinsic duration shall be
the difference between the absolute begin and end offsets. For a media
type having no notion of time (such as a JPEG image), the duration shall
be considered to be infinity.

If the simple duration is longer than the intrinsic duration, the player
shall freeze the media in its final state until the simple duration has
elapsed. For visual media types, the last appearance (frame) shall be
displayed. For aural media types, the media is logically frozen but
shall not continue to produce sound.

NOTE 2 In this case, the ***RC*** entry, which specifies a repeat count,
applies to the simple duration; therefore, the entire play-pause
sequence is repeated ***RC*** times.

**13.2.6 Media Screen Parameters**

> **13.2.6.1 General**

A media screen parameters dictionary (see Table 282) shall specify where
a media object should be played. It shall contain **MH** and **BE**
dictionaries (see Table 283), which shall function as discussed in
13.2.2, "Viability." All media clips that are being played shall be
associated with a particular document and shall be stopped when the
document is closed.

NOTE Conforming readers should disallow floating windows and full-screen
windows unless specifically allowed by the user. The reason is that
document-based security attacks are possible if windows containing
arbitrary media content can be displayed without indicating to the user
that the window is merely hosting a media object. This recommendation
may be relaxed if it is possible to communicate the nature of such
windows to the user; for example, with text in a floating window's title
bar.

+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| **M**   | integer    | *(Optional)* A monitor specifier (see    |
|         |            | Table 293) that shall specify which      |
|         |            | monitor in a multi-monitor system, a     |

|         |            | Default value: 0 (document monitor).     |
|         |            | Unrecognized value in **MH**: object is  |
|         |            | non-viable; in **BE**: treat as default  |
|         |            | value.                                   |
+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| **F**   | dictionary | *(Required if the value of **W** is 0;   |
|         |            | otherwise ignored)* A floating window    |
|         |            | parameters dictionary (see Table 284)    |
|         |            | that shall specify the size, position,   |
|         |            | and options used in displaying floating  |
|         |            | windows.                                 |
+---------+------------+------------------------------------------+

The **F** entry in the media screen parameters **MH**/**BE**
dictionaries shall be a floating window parameters dictionary, whose
entries are listed in Table 284. The entries in the floating window
parameters dictionary shall be treated as if they were present in the
**MH** or **BE** dictionaries that they are referenced from. That is,
the contained entries shall be individually evaluated for viability
rather than the dictionary being evaluated as a whole. (There may be an
**F** entry in both **MH** and **BE**. In such a case, if a given entry
is present in both floating window parameters dictionaries, the one in
the **MH** dictionary shall take precedence.)

The **D**, **P**, and **RT** entries shall be used to specify the
rectangle that the floating window occupies. Once created, the floating
window's size and position shall not be tied to any other window, even
if the initial size or position was computed relative to other windows.

Unrecognized values for the **R**, **P**, **RT**, and **O** entries
shall be handled as follows: if they are nested within an **MH**
dictionary, the floating window parameters object (and hence the media
screen parameters object) shall be considered non-viable; if they are
nested within a **BE** dictionary, they shall be considered to have
their default values.

This sub-clause defines several dictionary types that are referenced by
the previous sub-clauses.

> **13.2.7.2 Media Players Dictionary**

A media players dictionary may be referenced by media clip data (see
13.2.4.2, "Media Clip Data") and media play parameters (see 13.2.5,
"Media Play Parameters") dictionaries, and shall allow them to specify
which players may or may not be used to play the associated media. The
media players dictionary references *media player info dictionaries*
(see 13.2.7.3, "Media Player Info Dictionary") that shall provide
specific information about each player.

+----------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **MU**   | array    | *(Optional)* An array of media player    |
|          |          | info dictionaries (see Table 291) that   |
|          |          | shall specify a set of players, one of   |
|          |          | which shall be used in playing the       |

+----------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **A**    | array    | *(Optional)* An array of media player    |
|          |          | info dictionaries (see Table 291) that   |
|          |          | shall specify a set of players, any of   |
|          |          | which *may* be used in playing the       |
|          |          | associated media object. If **MU** is    |
|          |          | also present and non-empty, **A** shall  |
|          |          | be ignored.                              |
+----------+----------+------------------------------------------+
| **NU**   | array    | *(Optional)* An array of media player    |
|          |          | info dictionaries (see Table 291) that   |
|          |          | shall specify a set of players that      |
|          |          | shall *not* be used in playing the       |
|          |          | associated media object (even if they    |
|          |          | are also specified in **MU**).           |
+----------+----------+------------------------------------------+

The **MU**, **A**, and **NU** entries each shall specify one or more
media player info dictionaries. An empty array shall be treated as if it
is not present. The media player info dictionaries shall be allowed to
specify overlapping player ranges.

NOTE 1 **MU** could contain a media player info dictionary describing
versions 1 to 10 of Player X and another describing versions 3 through 5
of Player X.

If a non-viable media player info dictionary is referenced by **MU**,
**NU**, or **A**, it shall be treated as if it were not present in its
original array, and a media player info dictionary containing the same
software identifier dictionary (see 13.2.7.4, "Software Identifier
Dictionary") shall logically considered present in **NU**. The same rule
shall apply to a media player info dictionary that contains a partially
unrecognized software identifier dictionary.

Since both media clip data and media play parameters dictionaries may be
employed in a play operation, and each may reference a media players
dictionary, there is a potential for conflict between the contents of
the two media players dictionaries. At play-time, the viewer shall use
the following algorithm to determine whether a player present on the
machine may be employed. The player may not be used if any of the
following conditions are true:

> **Algorithm: Media Player**

a)  The content type is known and the player does not support the type.

b)  The player is found in the **NU** array of either dictionary.

c)  Both dictionaries have non-empty **MU** arrays and the player is not
    found in both of them, or only one of the dictionaries has a
    non-empty **MU** array and the player is not found in it.

d)  Neither dictionary has a non-empty **MU** array, the content type is
    not known, and the player is not found in the **A** array of either
    dictionary.

If none of the conditions are true, the player may be used.

NOTE 2 A player is "found" in the ***NU***, ***MU***, or ***A*** arrays
if it matches the information found in the PID entry of one of the
entries, as described by the Algorithm in 13.2.7.4, "Software Identifier
Dictionary."

> **13.2.7.3 Media Player Info Dictionary**

A *media player info dictionary* shall provide a variety of information
regarding a specific media player. Its entries

(see Table 291) shall associate information with a particular version or
range of versions of a player. As of PDF

1.5, only the **PID** entry shall provide information about the player,
as described in the next sub-clause, 13.2.7.4, "Software Identifier
Dictionary."

> **13.2.7.4 Software Identifier Dictionary**

**13.2.7.4.1 General**

A *software identifier dictionary* shall allow software to be identified
by name, range of versions, and operating systems; its entries are
listed in Table 292. A conforming reader uses this information to
determine whether a given media player may be used in a given situation.
If the dictionary contains keys that are unrecognized by the conforming
reader, it shall be considered to be partially recognized. The
conforming reader may or may not decide to treat the software identifier
as viable, depending on the context in which it is used.

The following procedure shall be used to determine whether a piece of
software is considered to match a software identifier dictionary:

> **Algorithm: Software identifier**

a)  The software name shall match the name specified by the **U** entry
    (see "Software URIs" in 13.2.7.4, "Software Identifier Dictionary").

b)  The software version shall be within the interval specified by the
    **L**, **H**, **LI**, and **H1** entries (see "Version arrays" in
    13.2.7.4, "Software Identifier Dictionary").

c)  The machine's operating system name shall be an exact match for one
    present in the **OS** array. If the array is not present or empty, a
    match shall also be considered to exist.

**13.2.7.4.2 Software URIs**

The **U** entry is a URI (universal resource identifier) that identifies
a piece of software. It shall be interpreted according to its scheme;
the only presently defined scheme is *vnd.adobe.swname*. The scheme name
is caseinsensitive; if shall not be recognized by the conforming reader,
the software shall be considered a non-match. The syntax of URIs of this
scheme is

> "vnd.adobe.swname:" *software_name*

where *software_name* shall be *reg_name* as defined in Internet RFC
2396, *Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax*; see the
Bibliography. *software_name* shall be a sequence of UTF-8-encoded
characters that have been escaped with one pass of URL escaping (see
14.10.3.2, "URL Strings"). That is, to recover the original software
name, *software_name* shall be unescaped and then treated as a sequence
of UTF-8 characters. The actual software names shall be compared in a
case-sensitive fashion.

Software names shall be second-class names (see Annex E).

EXAMPLE The URI for Adobe Acrobat is

> vnd.adobe.swname:ADBE_Acrobat

**13.2.7.4.3 Version arrays**

The **L**, **H**, **LI**, and **HI** entries shall be used to specify a
range of software versions. **L** and H shall be *version arrays*
containing zero or more non-negative integers representing subversion
numbers. The first integer shall be the major version numbers, and
subsequent integers shall be increasingly minor. **H** shall be greater
than or equal to **L**, according to the following rules for comparing
version arrays:

> **Algorithm: Comparing version arrays**

a)  An empty version array shall be treated as infinity; that is, it
    shall be considered greater than any other version array except
    another empty array. Two empty arrays are equal.

b)  When comparing arrays that contain different numbers of elements,
    the smaller array shall be implicitly padded with zero-valued
    integers to make the number of elements equal.

EXAMPLE When comparing \[5 1 2 3 4\] to \[5\], the latter is treated as
\[5 0 0 0 0\].

c)  The corresponding elements of the arrays shall be compared, starting
    with the first. When a difference is found, the array containing the
    larger element shall be considered to have the larger version
    number. If no differences are found, the versions are equal.

If a version array contains negative numbers, it shall be considered
non-viable, as is the enclosing software identifier.

> **13.2.7.5 Monitor Specifier**

A *monitor specifier* is an integer that shall identify a physical
monitor attached to a system. It may have one of the values in Table
293:

> **Table 293 -- Monitor specifier values**

  ---------------------------------------------------
  **Value**   **Description**
  ----------- ---------------------------------------
  0           The monitor containing the largest
              section of the document window

  1           The monitor containing the smallest
              section of the document window

  2           Primary monitor. If no monitor is
              considered primary, shall treat as case
              0

  3           Monitor with the greatest colour depth

  4           Monitor with the greatest area (in
              pixels squared)

  5           Monitor with the greatest height (in
              pixels)

  6           Monitor with the greatest width (in
              pixels)
  ---------------------------------------------------

For some of these values, it is possible have a "tie" at play-time; for
example, two monitors might have the same colour depth. Ties may be
broken in an implementation-dependent manner.

### 13.3 Sounds

A *sound object (PDF 1.2)* shall be a stream containing sample values
that define a sound to be played through the computer's speakers. The
**Sound** entry in a sound annotation or sound action dictionary (see
Table 185 and Table 208) shall identify a sound object representing the
sound to be played when the annotation is activated.

Since a sound object is a stream, it may contain any of the standard
entries common to all streams, as described in Table 5. In particular,
if it contains an **F** (file specification) entry, the sound shall be
defined in an external file. This sound file shall be self-describing,
containing all information needed to render the sound; no additional
information need be present in the PDF file.

NOTE The AIFF, AIFF-C (Mac OS), RIFF (*. wav*), and snd (*. au*) file
formats are all self-describing.

If no **F** entry is present, the sound object itself shall contain the
sample data and all other information needed to define the sound. Table
294 shows the additional dictionary entries specific to a sound object.

> **Table 294 -- Additional entries specific to a sound object**

| **CO**  | name      | *(Optional)* The sound compression format |
|         |           | used on the sample data. (This is         |
|         |           | separate from any stream compression      |
|         |           | specified by the sound object's           |
|         |           | **Filter** entry; see Table 5 and 7.4,    |
|         |           | "Filters.") If this entry is absent,      |
|         |           | sound compression shall not be used; the  |
|         |           | data contains sampled waveforms that      |
|         |           | shall be played at **R** samples per      |
|         |           | second per channel.                       |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **CP**  | (various) | *(Optional)* Optional parameters specific |
|         |           | to the sound compression format used.     |
|         |           |                                           |
|         |           | No standard values have been defined for  |
|         |           | the ***CO*** and ***CP*** entries.        |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+

Sample values shall be stored in the stream with the most significant
bits first (big-endian order for samples larger than 8 bits). Samples
that are not a multiple of 8 bits shall be packed into consecutive
bytes, starting at the most significant end. If a sample extends across
a byte boundary, the most significant bits shall be placed in the first
byte, followed by less significant bits in subsequent bytes. For
dual-channel stereophonic sounds, the samples shall be stored in an
interleaved format, with each sample value for the left channel
(channel 1) preceding the corresponding sample for the right (channel
2).

To maximize the portability of PDF documents containing embedded sounds,
conforming readers should support at least the following formats
(assuming the platform has sufficient hardware and OS support to play
sounds at all):

**R** 8000, 11,025, or 22,050 samples per second

**C** 1 or 2 channels

**B** 8 or 16 bits per channel

**E** Raw, Signed, or muLaw encoding

If the encoding (**E**) is Raw or Signed, **R** shall be 11,025 or
22,050 samples per channel. If the encoding is muLaw, **R** shall be
8000 samples per channel, **C** shall be 1 channel, and **B** shall be 8
bits per channel. Sound players shall convert between formats,
downsample rates, and combine channels as necessary to render sound on
the target platform.

### 13.4 Movies

The features described in this sub-clause are obsolescent and their use
is no longer recommended. They are superseded by the general multimedia
framework described in 13.2, "Multimedia."

PDF shall embed *movies* within a document by means of movie annotations
(see 12.5.6.17, "Movie Annotations"). Despite the name, a movie may
consist entirely of sound with no visible images to be displayed on the
screen. The **Movie** and **A** (activation) entries in the movie
annotation dictionary shall refer, respectively, to a *movie dictionary*
(Table 295) that shall describe the static characteristics of the movie
and a *movie activation dictionary* (Table 296) that shall specify how
it shall be presented.

### 13.5 Alternate Presentations

Beginning with PDF 1.4, a PDF document shall contain *alternate
presentations*, which specify alternate ways in which the document may
be viewed. The optional **AlternatePresentations** entry *(PDF 1.4)* in
a document's name dictionary (see Table 31) contains a name tree that
maps name strings to the alternate presentations available for the
document.

NOTE 1 Since conforming readers are not required to support alternate
presentations, authors of documents containing alternate presentations
should define the files such that something useful and meaningful can be
displayed and printed. For example, if the document contains an
alternate presentation slideshow of a sequence of photographs, the
photographs should be viewable in a static form by viewers that are not
capable of playing the slideshow.

As of PDF 1.5, the only type of alternate presentation is a *slideshow*.
Slideshows may be invoked by means of JavaScript actions (see 12.6.4.16,
"JavaScript Actions") initiated by user action on an interactive form
element (see 12.7, "Interactive Forms").

The following table shows the entries in a slideshow dictionary.

### 13.6 3D Artwork

**13.6.1 General**

Starting with PDF 1.6, collections of three-dimensional objects, such as
those used by CAD software, may be embedded in PDF files. Such
collections are often called *3D models*; in the context of PDF, they
shall be referred to as *3D artwork*. The PDF constructs for 3D artwork
support the following features:

- 3D artwork may be rendered within a page; that is, not as a separate
  window or user interface element.

- Multiple instances of 3D artwork may appear within a page or document.

- Specific views of 3D artwork may be specified, including a default
  view that shall be displayed initially and other views that may be
  selected. Views may have names that can be presented in a user
  interface.

- (*PDF 1.7*) Conforming readers may specify how 3D artwork shall be
  rendered, coloured, lit, and crosssectioned, without the use of
  embedded JavaScript. They may also specify state information that
  shall be applied to individual nodes (3D graphic objects or
  collections thereof) in the 3D artwork, such as visibility, opacity,
  position, or orientation.

- Pages containing 3D artwork may be printed.

- Users may rotate and move the artwork, enabling them to examine
  complex objects from any angle or orientation.

- (*PDF 1.7*) Keyframe animations contained in 3D artwork may be played
  in specific styles and timescales, without programatic intervention.

- JavaScripts and other software may programmatically manipulate objects
  in the artwork, creating dynamic presentations in which objects move,
  spin, appear, and disappear.

- (*PDF 1.7*) The activation of 3D artwork can trigger the display of
  additional user interface items in the conforming reader. Such items
  may include model trees and toolbars.

- Two-dimensional (2D) content such as labels may be overlaid on 3D
  artwork. This feature is not the same as the ability to apply 2D
  markup annotations.

- *(PDF 1.7)* 2D markup annotations may be applied to specific views of
  the 3D artwork, using the **ExData** entry to identify the 3D
  annotation and the 3D view in that annotation.

The following sub-clauses describe the major PDF objects that relate to
3D artwork, as well as providing background information on 3D graphics:

- *3D annotations* provide a *virtual camera* through which the artwork
  shall be viewed. (see 13.6.2, "3D Annotations").

- *3D streams* shall contain the actual specification of a piece of 3D
  artwork (see 13.6.3, "3D Streams""). This specification supports the
  Standard ECMA-363, *Universal 3D file format* developed by the 3D
  Industry Forum (see Bibliography).

- *3D views* shall specify information about the relationship between
  the camera and the 3D artwork (see 13.6.4, "3D Views"). Beginning with
  PDF 1.7, views may also describe additional parameters such as render
  mode, lighting, cross sections, and nodes. Nodes shall be 3D graphic
  objects or collections thereof.

- 3D coordinate systems are described in 13.6.5, "Coordinate Systems for
  3D."

- 2D markup annotations applied to 3D artwork views are described in
  13.6.6, "3D Markup."

NOTE Many of the concepts and terminology of 3D rendering are beyond the
scope of this reference. Readers interested in further information are
encouraged to consult outside references.

**13.6.2 3D Annotations**

3D annotations (*PDF 1.6*) are the means by which 3D artwork shall be
represented in a PDF document. Table 298 shows the entries specific to a
3D annotation dictionary. Table 164 describes the entries common to all
annotation dictionaries.

In addition to these entries, a 3D annotation shall provide an
appearance stream in its **AP** entry (see Table 164) that has a normal
appearance (the **N** entry in Table 168). This appearance may be used
by applications that do not support 3D annotations and by all
applications for the initial display of the annotation.

| **3DB** | rectangle | *(Optional)* The 3D view box, which is |
|         |           | the rectangular area in which the 3D   |
|         |           | artwork shall be drawn. It shall be    |
|         |           | within the rectangle specified by the  |
|         |           | annotation's **Rect** entry and shall  |
|         |           | be expressed in the annotation's       |
|         |           | target coordinate system (see          |
|         |           | discussion following this Table).      |
|         |           |                                        |
|         |           | Default value: the annotation's        |
|         |           | **Rect** entry, expressed in the       |
|         |           | target coordinate system. This value   |
|         |           | is \[ -*w*/2 -*h*/2 *w*/2 *h*/2 \],    |
|         |           | where *w* and *h* are the width and    |
|         |           | height, respectively, of **Rect**.     |
+---------+-----------+----------------------------------------+

The **3DB** entry specifies the *3D view box*, a rectangle in which the
3D artwork appears. The view box shall fit within the annotation's
rectangle (specified by its **Rect** entry). It may be the same size, or
it may be smaller if necessary to provide extra drawing area for
additional 2D graphics within the annotation.

NOTE 1 Although 3D artwork can internally specify viewport size,
conforming readers ignore it in favour of information provided by the
***3DB*** entry.

The view box shall be specified in the annotation's *target coordinate
system*, whose origin is at the center of the annotation's rectangle.
Units in this coordinate system are the same as default user space
units. Therefore, the coordinates of the annotation's rectangle in the
target coordinate system are

\[ -*w*/2 -*h*/2 *w*/2 *h*/2 \] given *w* and *h* as the rectangle's
width and height.

The **3DD** entry shall specify a 3D stream that contains the 3D artwork
to be shown in the annotation; 3D streams are described in Section
13.6.3. The **3DD** entry may specify a 3D stream directly; it may also
specify a 3D stream indirectly by means of a 3D reference dictionary
(see 13.6.3.3, \"3D Reference Dictionaries\"). These options control
whether annotations shall share the same run-time instance of the
artwork.

The **3DV** entry shall specify the view of the 3D artwork that is
displayed when the annotation is activated (as described in the next
paragraph). 3D views, which are described in Section 13.6.4, represent
settings for the virtual camera, such as position, orientation, and
projection style. The view specified by **3DV** shall be one of the 3D
view dictionaries listed in the **VA** entry in a 3D stream (see Table
300).

The **3DA** entry shall be an activation dictionary (see Table 299) that
determines how the *state* of the annotation and its associated artwork
may change.

NOTE 2 These states serve to delay the processing or display of 3D
artwork until a user chooses to interact with it.

> Such delays in activating 3D artwork can be advantageous to
> performance.

At any given moment, a 3D annotation shall be in one of two states:

- *Inactive* (the default initial state): the annotation displays the
  annotation's normal appearance.

NOTE 3 It is typical, though not required, for the normal appearance to
be a pre-rendered bitmap of the default view of the 3D artwork.
Conforming writers should provide bitmaps of appropriate resolution for
all intended uses of the document; for example, a high-resolution bitmap
for high-quality printing and a screen-resolution bitmap for on-screen
viewing. Optional content (see 8.11, "Optional Content") may be used to
select the appropriate bitmap for each situation.

- *Active*: the annotation displays a rendering of the 3D artwork. This
  rendering shall be specified by the annotation's **3DV** entry.

|         |          | information about the 3D artwork. Such |
|         |          | user interfaces can enable navigation  |
|         |          | to different views or can depict the   |
|         |          | hierarchy of the objects in the        |
|         |          | artwork (the model tree). If **true**, |
|         |          | the user interface should be made      |
|         |          | visible when the annotation is         |
|         |          | activated. If **false**, the user      |
|         |          | interface should not be made visible   |
|         |          | by default.                            |

+---------+----------+----------------------------------------+

The **A** and **D** entries of the activation dictionary determine when
a 3D annotation may become active and inactive. The **AIS** and **DIS**
entries determine what state the associated artwork shall be in when the
annotation is activated or deactivated. 3D artwork may be in one of
three states:

- *Uninstantiated:* the initial state of the artwork before it has been
  used in any way.

- *Instantiated*: the state in which the artwork has been read and a
  run-time instance of the artwork has been created. In this state, it
  may be rendered but script-driven real-time modifications (that is,
  animations) shall be disabled.

- *Live*: the artwork has been instantiated, and it is being modified in
  real time to achieve some animation effect. In the case of keyframe
  animation, the artwork shall be live while it is playing and then
  shall revert to an instantiated state when playing completes or is
  stopped.

NOTE 4 The live state is valid only for keyframe animations or in
interactive conforming readers that have JavaScript support.

If 3D artwork becomes uninstantiated after having been instantiated,
later use of the artwork requires reinstantiation (animations are lost,
and the artwork appears in its initial form).

NOTE 5 For this reason, uninstantiation is not necessary unless the
artwork has been modified in some way; consumers may choose to keep
unchanged artwork instantiated for performance reasons.

NOTE 6 In non-interactive systems such as printing systems, the artwork
cannot be changed. Therefore, applications may choose to deactivate
annotations and uninstantiate artwork differently, based on factors such
as memory usage and the time needed to instantiate artwork, and the
***TB***, ***NP***, ***D*** and ***DIS*** entries may be ignored.

Multiple 3D annotations may share an instance of 3D artwork, as
described in 13.6.3.3, \"3D Reference Dictionaries\". In such a case,
the state of the artwork instance shall be determined in the following
way:

- If any active annotation dictates (through its activation dictionary)
  that the artwork shall be live, it shall be live.

- Otherwise, if any active annotation dictates that the artwork shall be
  instantiated, it shall be instantiated.

- Otherwise (that is, all active annotations dictate that the artwork
  shall be uninstantiated), the artwork shall be uninstantiated.

The rules described in 13.6.2, "3D Annotations", apply only to active
annotations. If all annotations referring to the artwork are inactive,
the artwork nevertheless may be uninstantiated, instantiated, or live 3D
Streams.

**13.6.3 3D Streams**

> **13.6.3.1 General**

The specification of 3D artwork shall be contained in a *3D stream*. 3D
stream dictionaries, whose entries (in addition to the regular stream
dictionary\'s entries; see 7.3.7, "Dictionary Objects") are shown in
Table 300, may provide a set of predefined views of the artwork, as well
as a default view. They may also provide scripts and resources for
providing customized behaviours or presentations.

|                   |            | The names in this name tree shall be  |
|                   |            | text strings so as to be encoded in a |
|                   |            | way that will be accessible from      |
|                   |            | JavaScript.                           |
+-------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **OnInstantiate** | stream     | *(Optional)* A JavaScript script that |
|                   |            | shall be executed when the 3D stream  |
|                   |            | is instantiated.                      |
+-------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+
| **AN**            | dictionary | *(Optional; PDF 1.7)* An *animation   |
|                   |            | style dictionary* indicating the      |
|                   |            | method that conforming readers should |
|                   |            | use to drive keyframe animations      |
|                   |            | present in this artwork (see          |
|                   |            | 13.6.3.2, \"3D Animation Style        |
|                   |            | Dictionaries\").                      |
|                   |            |                                       |
|                   |            | Default value: an animation style     |
|                   |            | dictionary whose **Subtype** entry    |
|                   |            | has a value of **None**.              |
+-------------------+------------+---------------------------------------+

The **Subtype** entry specifies the format of the 3D stream data. The
only valid value is **U3D**, which indicates that the stream data
conforms to the *Universal 3D File Format* specification (see
Bibliography). Conforming readers shall be prepared to encounter unknown
values for **Subtype** and recover appropriately, which usually means
leaving the annotation in its inactive state, displaying its normal
appearance.

NOTE Conforming readers should follow the approach of falling back to
the normal appearance with regard to entries in other dictionaries that
may take different types or values than the ones specified here.

If present, the **VA** entry shall be an array containing a list of
named present views of the 3D artwork. Each entry in the array shall be
a 3D view dictionary (see 13.6.4, "3D Views") that shall contain the
name of the view and the information needed to display the view. The
order of array elements determines the order in which the views shall be
presented in a user interface. The **DV** entry specifies the view that
shall be used as the initial view of the 3D artwork.

Default views shall be determined in the following order of precedence:
in the annotation dictionary, in the 3D stream dictionary, or in the 3D
artwork contained in the 3D stream.

3D streams contain information that may be used by conforming readers
and by scripts to perform animations and other programmatically-defined
behaviours, such as changing the viewing orientation or moving
individual components of the artwork. If present, the **OnInstantiate**
entry shall contain a JavaScript script that shall be executed by
applications that support JavaScript whenever a 3D stream is read to
create an instance of the 3D artwork. The **Resources** entry shall be a
name tree that contains objects that may be used to modify the initial
appearance of the 3D artwork.

> **13.6.3.2 3D Animation Style Dictionaries**

A *3D animation style dictionary* *(PDF 1.7)* specifies the method that
conforming readers should use to apply timeline scaling to keyframe
animations. It may also specify that keyframe animations be played
repeatedly. The **AN** entry of the 3D stream shall specify a 3D
animation style dictionary.

A keyframe animation may be provided as the content of a 3D stream
dictionary. A keyframe animation provides key frames and specifies the
mapping for the position of geometry over a set period of time
(*animation timeline*). Keyframe animation is an interactive feature
that is highly dependent on the behaviour and controls provided by the
conforming reader.

Table 301 shows the entries in an animation style dictionary.

> **Table 301 -- Entries in an 3D animation style dictionary**

+-------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| **Key**     | **Type** | **Value**                               |
+:============+:=========+=========================================+
| **Type**    | name     | (*Optional*). The type of PDF object    |
|             |          | that this dictionary describes; if      |
|             |          | present, shall be **3DAnimationStyle**. |
+-------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| **Subtype** | name     | (*Optional*) The animation style        |
|             |          | described by this dictionary; see Table |
|             |          | 302 for valid values. If an animation   |
|             |          | style is encountered other than those   |
|             |          | described in Table 302, an animation    |
|             |          | style of **None** shall be used.        |
|             |          |                                         |
|             |          | Default value: **None**                 |
+-------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| **PC**      | integer  | (*Optional*) An integer specifying the  |
|             |          | play count for this animation style. A  |
|             |          | non-negative integer represents the     |
|             |          | number of times the animation shall be  |
|             |          | played. A negative integer indicates    |
|             |          | that the animation shall be infinitely  |
|             |          | repeated. This value shall be ignored   |
|             |          | for animation styles of type **None**.  |
|             |          | Default value: 0                        |
+-------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+
| **TM**      | number   | (*Optional*) A positive number          |
|             |          | specifying the time multiplier to be    |
|             |          | used when running the animation. A      |
|             |          | value greater than one shortens the     |
|             |          | time it takes to play the animation, or |
|             |          | effectively speeds up the animation.    |
|             |          |                                         |
|             |          | NOTE This allows authors to adjust the  |
|             |          | desired speed of animations, without    |
|             |          | having to re-author the 3D artwork.     |
|             |          |                                         |
|             |          | This value shall be ignored for         |
|             |          | animation styles of type **None**.      |
|             |          |                                         |
|             |          | Default value: 1                        |
+-------------+----------+-----------------------------------------+

The descriptions of the animation styles (see Table 302) use the
following variables to represent application time or keyframe settings
specified in the 3D artwork.

- *t* is a point on the animation time line. This value shall be used in
  conjunction with the keyframe animation data to determine the state of
  the 3D artwork.

- \[*r~0~*, *r~1~*\] is the keyframe animation time line.

- *t~a~* is the current time of the conforming reader.

- *t~0~* is the time when the conforming reader starts the animation.

- *p* is the time it takes to play the keyframe animation through one
  cycle. In the case of the **Linear** animation style, one cycle
  consists of playing the animation through once from beginning to end.
  In the case of the **Oscillating** animation style, one cycle consists
  of playing the animation from beginning to end and then from end to
  beginning.

- *m* is the positive multiplier specified by the **TM** entry in the
  animation style dictionary.

|                 | back-and-forth playing of the       |
|                 | animation, such as exploding or     |

> **13.6.3.3 3D Reference Dictionaries**

More than one 3D annotation may be associated with the same 3D artwork.
There are two ways in which this association may occur, as determined by
the annotation's **3DD** entry (see Table 298):

- If the **3DD** entry specifies a 3D stream, the annotation shall have
  its own run-time instance of the 3D artwork. Any changes to the
  artwork shall be reflected only in this annotation. Other annotations
  that refer to the same stream shall have separate run-time instances.

- If the **3DD** entry specifies a 3D reference dictionary (whose
  entries are shown in Table 303), the annotation shall have a run-time
  instance of the 3D artwork with all other annotations that specify the
  same reference dictionary. Any changes to the artwork shall be
  reflected in all such annotations.

  **Type**   name       *(Optional)* The type of PDF object
                        that this dictionary describes; if
                        present, shall be **3DRef** for a 3D
                        reference dictionary.

  **3DD**    stream     *(Required)* The 3D stream (see 13.6.3,
                        "3D Streams") containing the
                        specification of the 3D artwork.
  -------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE The following example and Figure 66 through Figure 68 show three
annotations that use the same 3D artwork. Object 100 (Annotation 1) has
its own run-time instance of the 3D stream (object 200); object
101(Annotation 2) and object 102 (Annotation 3) share a run-time
instance through the 3D reference dictionary (object 201).

NOTE When multiple annotations refer to the same instance of 3D artwork,
the state of the instance is determined as described in 13.6.2, "3D
Annotations."

**13.6.4 3D Views**

> **13.6.4.1 General**

A *3D view* (or simply *view*) specifies parameters that shall be
applied to the virtual camera associated with a 3D annotation. These
parameters may include orientation and position of the camera, details
regarding the projection of camera coordinates into the annotation's
target coordinate system, and a description of the background on which
the artwork shall be drawn. Starting with PDF 1.7, views may specify how
3D artwork is rendered, coloured, lit, and cross-sectioned, without the
use of embedded JavaScript. Views may also specify which nodes
(three-dimensional areas) of 3D artwork shall be included in a view and
whether those nodes are opaque or invisible.

NOTE 1 Users can manipulate views by performing interactive operations
such as free rotation and translation. In addition, 3D artwork can
contain a set of predefined views that the author deems to be of
particular interest. For example, a mechanical drawing of a part may
have specific views showing the top, bottom, left, right, front, and
back of an object.

A 3D stream may contain a list of named preset views of the 3D artwork,
as specified by the **VA** entry, which shall be an array of 3D view
dictionaries. The entries in a 3D view dictionary are shown in Table
304.

|         |            | original states (as specified in the   |

|         |            | **false**, the dictionaries specified  |
|         |            | by the **NA** array shall be applied   |
|         |            | to the current states of the nodes.    |

+---------+------------+----------------------------------------+

For any view, the conforming writer may provide 2D content specific to
the view, to be drawn on top of the 3D artwork. The **O** entry
specifies a form XObject that shall be overlaid on the rendered 3D
artwork. The coordinate system of the form XObject shall be defined to
be the same as the (*x*, *y*, 0) plane in the camera coordinate system
(see 13.6.5, "Coordinate Systems for 3D").

Use of the **O** entry is subject to the following restrictions.

NOTE 2 Failure to abide by them could result in misalignment of the
overlay with the rendered 3D graphics:

- It may be specified only in 3D view dictionaries in which both a
  camera-to-world matrix (**MS** and associated entries) and a
  projection dictionary (the **P** entry) are present.

- The form XObject shall be associated with a specific view (not with
  the camera position defined by the 3D view dictionary). The conforming
  reader should draw it only when the user navigates using the 3D view,
  not when the user happens to navigate to the same orientation by
  manual means.

- The confirming reader should draw it only if the user has not invoked
  any actions that alter the artwork-to-world matrix.

The **CO** entry specifies the distance from the camera to the *center
of orbit* for the 3D view, which is the point around which the camera
shall rotate when performing an orbit-style navigation. Figure 69
illustrates camera positioning when orbiting around the center of orbit.

NOTE 3 The **LS** entry allows the lighting of the 3D artwork to be
changed without changing the artwork itself. This enables consumers to
view a given piece of 3D artwork with a variety of lighting options
without requiring multiple copies of the 3D artwork stream that differ
only in lighting. It also enables artwork with poor lighting to be
corrected in cases where the original content cannot be re-authored. See
13.6.4.5, "3D Lighting Scheme Dictionaries."

A *projection dictionary* (see Table 305) defines the mapping of 3D
camera coordinates onto the target coordinate system of the annotation.
Each 3D view may specify a projection dictionary by means of its **P**
entry.

NOTE Although view nodes can specify projection information, PDF
consumers ignore it in favour of information in the projection
dictionary.

PDF 1.6 introduces *near/far clipping*. This type of clipping defines a
*near plane* and a *far plane* (as shown in Figure 70). Objects, or
parts of objects, that are beyond the far plane or closer to the camera
than the near plane are not drawn. 3D objects shall be projected onto
the near plane and then scaled and positioned within the annotation's
target coordinate system, as described Table 305.

+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+

The **CS** entry defines how the near and far planes are determined. A
value of **XNF** means that the **N** and **F** entries explicitly
specify the *z* coordinate of the near and far planes, respectively. A
value of **ANF** for **CS** means that the near and far planes shall be
determined automatically based on the objects in the artwork.

The **Subtype** entry specifies the type of projection, which determines
how objects are projected onto the near plane and scaled. The possible
values are **O** for *orthographic projection* and **P** for
*perspective projection*.

For orthographic projection, objects shall be projected onto the near
plane by simply discarding their *z* value. They shall be scaled from
units of the near plane's coordinate system to those of the annotation's
target coordinate system by the combined factors specified by the **OS**
entry and the OB entry.

For perspective projection, a given coordinate (*x*, *y*, *z*) shall be
projected onto the near plane, defining a 2D coordinate (*x~1~*, *y~1~*)
using the following formulas:

> n-x1 = x × z
>
> n-y1 = y × z

where *n* is the *z* coordinate of the near plane.

Scaling with perspective projection is more complicated than for
orthographic projection. The **FOV** entry specifies an angle that
defines a cone centered along the *z* axis in the camera coordinate
system (see Figure 70). The cone intersects with the near plane, forming
a circular area on the near plane. Figure 71 shows this circle and
graphics from the position of the camera.

The **PS** entry specifies the diameter that this circle will have when
the graphics projected onto the near plane are rendered in the
annotation's 3D view box (see Figure 72). Although the diameter of the
circle determines the scaling factor, graphics outside the circle shall
also be displayed, providing they fit within the view box, as seen in
the figure.

Figure 73 shows the entire 3D annotation. In this case, the 3D view box
is smaller than the annotation's rectangle, which also contains 2D
content outside the 3D view box.

A *3D background dictionary* defines the background over which a 3D view
shall be drawn.Table 306 shows the entries in a background dictionary.
Currently, only a single opaque colour is supported, where the colour
shall be defined in the **DeviceRGB** colour space. 3D artwork may
include transparent objects; however, there is no interaction between
such objects and objects drawn below the annotation. In effect, the 3D
artwork and its background form a transparency group whose flattened
results have an opacity of 1 (see 11, "Transparency").

NOTE An annotation's normal appearance should have the same behaviour
with respect to transparency when the appearance is intended to depict
the 3D artwork. This does not apply when the appearance is used for
another purpose, such as a compatibility warning message.

> **13.6.4.4 3D Render Mode Dictionaries**

A *3D render mode dictionary (PDF 1.7)* specifies the style in which the
3D artwork shall be rendered.

NOTE 1 Surfaces may be filled with opaque colours, they may be stroked
as a "wireframe," or the artwork may be rendered with special lighting
effects.

NOTE 2 A render mode dictionary enables document authors to customize
the rendered appearance of 3D artwork to suit the needs of the intended
consumer, without reauthoring the artwork. For conforming readers
concerned strictly with geometry, complex artwork rendered using the
**Wireframe** or **Points** style may have much better performance
without the added overhead of texturing and lighting effects. Artwork in
a document intended for print may have a much more integrated feel when
using the **Illustration** render mode style.

The **RM** entry in the 3D views dictionary may specify a 3D render mode
dictionary.

Table 307 shows the entries in a render mode dictionary.

For render modes that add a level of transparency to the rendering, the
**O** entry specifies the additional opacity that shall be used. All
such transparency effects use a standard additive blend mode.

The **CV** entry sets the crease value that shall be used when
determining silhouette edges, which may be used to adjust the appearance
of illustrated render modes. An edge shared by two faces shall be
considered a silhouette edge if either of the following conditions is
met:

- One face is front-facing and the other is back-facing.

- The angle between the two faces is greater than or equal to the crease
  value.

Table 308 describes the render modes that may be specified in a render
mode dictionary.

If a render mode type is encountered other than those described in Table
308, the render mode dictionary containing that entry shall be ignored
by its consumers. This allows future documents using new render modes to
behave consistently with future documents using new 3D view constructs
that are ignored by older viewers.

> **13.6.4.5 3D Lighting Scheme Dictionaries**

A *3D lighting scheme dictionary* *(PDF 1.7)* specifies the lighting to
apply to 3D artwork. The **LS** entry in the 3D view may include a 3D
lighting scheme dictionary.

Table 301 shows the entries in a 3D lighting scheme dictionary.

  **Type**        name       *(Optional)* The type of PDF
                             object that this dictionary
                             describes; if present, shall be
                             **3DLightingScheme**.

  **Subtype**     name       *(Required)* The style of lighting
                             scheme described by this
                             dictionary (see Table 310).
  -------------------------------------------------------------

Table 310 describes the supported lighting schemes. With the exception
of the **Artwork** lighting style, all the lights specified in Table 310
are *infinite* lights (also known as *distant* lights). Unlike lights
from a point source, all rays from an infinite light source are emitted
along a single direction vector. For lights specifying an *ambient*
term, this term shall be added to the diffuse colour of an object's
material. All colours shall be specified in the **DeviceRGB** colour
space.

When a style other than **Artwork** is used, only those lights described
shall be present; any lighting described in the artwork shall not be
used.

NOTE If a lighting scheme style is encountered other than those
described in Table 310, the lighting scheme dictionary containing that
entry shall be ignored. This allows future documents using new lighting
schemes to behave consistently with future documents using new 3D view
constructs. That is, the expected behaviour is for the conforming reader
to ignore unrecognized lighting styles and 3D view constructs.

> **13.6.4.6 3D Cross Section Dictionaries**

A *3D cross section dictionary* *(PDF 1.7)* specifies how a portion of
the 3D artwork shall be clipped for the purpose of showing artwork cross
sections. The **SA** entry of a 3D view may specify multiple 3D cross
section dictionaries.

NOTE Cross sections enable conforming readers to display otherwise
hidden parts of the artwork. They also allow users to comment on cross
sections, using markup annotations. For example, markup annotations can
be used to apply markup annotations to a cross section or to measure
distances in a cross section. If multiple cross sections are specified
for a view, the markup annotations in the view apply to all cross
sections in the view.

Table 311 shows the entries in a 3D cross section dictionary.

|          |          | values in that colour space. The only     |
|          |          | valid colour space is **DeviceRGB**. If a |
|          |          | colour space other than **DeviceRGB** is  |
|          |          | specified, this entry shall be ignored    |
|          |          | and the default value shall be used. This |
|          |          | entry is meaningful only if **IV** is     |
|          |          | **true**.                                 |

+----------+----------+-------------------------------------------+

The **C** entry specifies the center of the cutting plane. This implies
that the plane passes through the center point, but it is also the point
of reference when determining the orientation of the plane.

The **O** array indicates the orientation of the cutting plane, taking
into account its center. The orientation may be determined by a two-step
process:

- The plane shall be situated such that it passes through point **C**,
  and oriented such that it is perpendicular to the axis specified by
  the array entry whose value is null.

- For each of the other two axes, the plane shall be rotated the
  specified number of degrees around the associated axis, while
  maintaining **C** as a fixed point on the plane. Since the two axes
  are perpendicular, the order in which the rotations are performed is
  irrelevant.

The **PO** entry specifies the opacity of the plane itself when
rendered, while the **PC** entry provides its colour. When the **PO**
entry is greater than 0, a visual representation of the cutting plane
shall be rendered with the 3D artwork. This representation is a square
with a side length equal to the length of the diagonal of the maximum
bounding box for the 3D artwork, taking into account any keyframe
animations present. When the **PO** entry is 0, no visible
representation of the cutting plane shall be rendered.

The **IV** entry shall be a boolean value that determines whether a
visual indication shall be drawn of the plane's intersection with the 3D
artwork. If such an indication is drawn, the **IC** entry shall specify
its colour.

Figure 74 through Figure 78 use world coordinates whose origin is the
center of the cube. The axes illustrated in each diagram show the
relative orientation of the world coordinate axes, not the actual
position of those axes. These axes are not part of the 3D artwork used
in this example.

Figure 75 shows the cross section specified for the **3DView** that
references CrossSection1. The illustration shows the edges of the
cutting plane ending at the edges of the annotation's rectangle. This
cross section specifies a plane with the following characteristics:

- Includes the world art origin: /C \[0 0 0\]

- Perpendicular to the X axis and parallel to the Y and Z axes: /O \[

Figure 76 shows the cross section specified for the **3DView** that
references CrossSection2. This cross section specifies a plane that
differs from the one specified in CrossSection1 (Figure 75) in the
following way:

- Perpendicular to the *X* axis, rotated -30 degrees around the *Y*
  axis, and parallel to the *Z* axis: /O \[ null -30 0\]

> **13.6.4.7 3D Node Dictionaries**

A 3D view may specify a 3D node dictionary *(PDF 1.7)*, which specifies
particular areas of 3D artwork and the opacity and visibility with which
individual nodes shall be displayed. The 3D artwork shall be contained
in the parent 3D stream object. The **NA** entry of the 3D views
dictionary may specify multiple 3D node dictionaries for a particular
view.

NOTE 1 While many PDF dictionaries reference 3D artwork in its entirety,
it is often useful to reference 3D artwork at a more granular level.
This enables properties such as visibility, opacity, and orientation to
be applied to subsets of the 3D artwork. These controls enable
underlying nodes to be revealed, by making the overlying nodes
transparent or by moving them out of the way.

NOTE 2 Do not confuse nodes with view nodes. A node is a PDF dictionary
that specifies an area in 3D artwork, while a view node is a parameter
in the 3D artwork that specifies a view.

Table 312 shows the entries in a 3D node dictionary.

+--------------+----------+----------------------------------+

The **N** entry specifies which node in the 3D stream corresponds to
this node dictionary.

The **O** entry describes the opacity that shall be used when rendering
this node, and the **V** entry shall determine whether or not the node
is rendered at all. While a node with an opacity of 0 shall be rendered
in the same way as a non-visible node, having a separate value for the
visibility of a node allows interactive conforming readers to show/hide
partially transparent nodes, without overwriting the intended opacity of
those nodes.

The **M** entry specifies the node's matrix relative to its parent, in
world coordinates. If an hierarchy of nodes is intended to be
repositioned while still maintaining its internal structure, then only
the node at the root of the hierarchy needs to be adjusted.

- The node named Cone is opaque (/O 1) and invisible (/V false)

- The node named Cube is opaque (/O 1) and visible (/V true)

**13.6.5 Coordinate Systems for 3D**

3D artwork is a collection of objects whose positions and geometry shall
be specified using three-dimensional coordinates. 8.3, "Coordinate
Systems," discusses the concepts of two-dimensional coordinate systems,
their geometry and transformations. This sub-clause extends those
concepts to include the third dimension.

As described in 8.3, "Coordinate Systems," positions shall be defined in
terms of pairs of *x* and *y* coordinates on the Cartesian plane. The
origin of the plane specifies the location (0, 0); *x* values increase
to the right and *y* values increase upward. For three-dimensional
graphics, a third axis, the *z* axis, shall be used. The origin shall be
at (0, 0, 0); positive *z* values increase going into the page.

In two-dimensional graphics, the transformation matrix transforms the
position, size, and orientation of objects in a plane. It is a 3-by-3
matrix, where only six of the elements may be changed; therefore, the
matrix shall be expressed in PDF as an array of six numbers:

> a b 0 c d 0 = a b c d tx ty tx ty 1

In 3D graphics, a 4-by-4 matrix shall be used to transform the position,
size, and orientations of objects in a three-dimensional coordinate
system. Only the first three columns of the matrix may be changed;
therefore, the matrix shall be expressed in PDF as an array of 12
numbers:

a b c 0

> d e f 0 a b c d e f g h i tx ty tz
>
> g h i 0 tx ty tz 1

3D coordinate transformations shall be expressed as matrix
transformations:

a b c 0

d e f 0

> x\' y\' z\' 1
>
> g h i 0 tx ty tz 1

Carrying out the multiplication has the following results:

> x\' = a × x + d × y + g × z + tx y\' = b × x + e × y + h × z + ty z\'
> = c × x + f × y + i × z + tz

Position and orientation of 3D artwork typically involves translation
(movement) and rotation along any axis. The virtual camera represents
the view of the artwork. The relationship between camera and artwork may
be thought of in two ways:

- The 3D artwork is in a fixed position and orientation, and the camera
  moves to different positions and orientations.

- The camera is in a fixed location, and the 3D artwork is translated
  and rotated.

Both approaches may achieve the same visual effects; in practice, 3D
systems typically use a combination of both. Conceptually, there are
three distinct coordinate systems:

- The *artwork coordinate system*.

- The *camera coordinate system*, in which the camera shall be
  positioned at (0, 0, 0) facing out along the positive *z* axis, with
  the positive *x* axis to the right and the positive *y* axis going
  straight up.

- An intermediate system called the *world coordinate system*.

Two 3D transformation matrices shall be used in coordinate conversions:

- The *artwork-to-world matrix* specifies the position and orientation
  of the artwork in the world coordinate system. This matrix shall be
  contained in the 3D stream.

- The *camera-to-world matrix* specifies the position and orientation of
  the camera in the world coordinate system. This matrix shall be
  specified by either the **C2W** or **U3DPath** entries of the 3D view
  dictionary.

When drawing 3D artwork in a 3D annotation's target coordinate system,
the following transformations take place:

a)  Artwork coordinates shall be transformed to world coordinates:

> xw yw zw xa ya za 1 × aw

b)  World coordinates shall be transformed to camera coordinates:

> xc yc zc xw yw zw 1 × (cw--1)

c)  The first two steps can be expressed as a single equation, as
    follows:

> xc yc zc xa ya za 1 × (aw × cw--1)

d)  Finally, the camera coordinates shall be projected into two
    dimensions, eliminating the *z* coordinate, then scaled and
    positioned within the annotation's target coordinate system.

**13.6.6 3D Markup**

Beginning with PDF 1.7, users may comment on specific views of 3D
artwork by using markup annotations (see 12.5.6.2, "Markup
Annotations"). Markup annotations (as other annotations) are normally
associated with a location on a page. To associate the markup with a
specific view of a 3D annotation, the annotation dictionary for the
markup annotation contains an **ExData** entry (see Table 174) that
specifies the 3D annotation and view. Table 313 describes the entries in
an external data dictionary used to markup 3D annotations.

In a **Markup3D** **ExData** dictionary, the **3DA** entry identifies
the 3D annotation to which the markup shall be associated. Even though
the markup annotation exists alongside the associated annotation in the
page's **Annots** array, the markup may be thought of as a child of the
**3DA** annotation.

The **3DV** entry specifies the markup's associated 3D view. The markup
shall only be printed and displayed when the specified view is the
current view of its parent 3D annotation. This ensures that the proper
context is preserved when the markup is displayed.

NOTE An equivalent view is not sufficient; if more than one markup
specify equivalent views represented by different objects, the markups
will not display simultaneously.

The **MD5** entry gives conforming readers a means to detect whether or
not the 3D stream of the 3D annotation specified by **3DA** has changed.
If the 3D stream has changed, the context provided by the **3DV** entry
may no longer apply, and the markup may no longer be useful. Any action
taken as a response to such a situation is dependent on the conforming
reader, but a warning shall be issued to the user.

EXAMPLE The following example shows how markup annotations can be
associated with particular views.

##  14 Document Interchange

### 14.1 General

The features described in this clause do not affect the final appearance
of a document. Rather, these features enable a document to include
higher-level information that is useful for the interchange of documents
among conforming products:

- *Procedure sets* (14.2, "Procedure Sets") that define the
  implementation of PDF operators

- *Metadata* (14.3, "Metadata") consisting of general information about
  a document or a component of a document, such as its title, author,
  and creation and modification dates

- *File identifiers* (14.4, "File Identifiers") for reliable reference
  from one PDF file to another

- *Page-piece dictionaries* (14.5, "Page-Piece Dictionaries") allowing a
  conforming product to embed private data in a PDF document for its own
  use

- *Marked-content* operators (14.6, "Marked Content") for identifying
  portions of a content stream and associating them with additional
  properties or externally specified objects

- *Logical structure* facilities (14.7, "Logical Structure") for
  imposing a hierarchical organization on the content of a document

- *Tagged PDF* (14.8, "Tagged PDF"), a set of conventions for using the
  marked content and logical structure facilities to facilitate the
  extraction and reuse of a document's content for other purposes

- Various ways of increasing the *accessibility* of a document to users
  with disabilities (14.9, "Accessibility Support"), including the
  identification of the natural language in which it is written (such as
  English or Spanish) for the benefit of a text-to-speech engine

- The *Web Capture* extension (14.10, " Web Capture"), which creates PDF
  files from Internet-based or locally resident HTML, PDF, GIF, JPEG,
  and ASCII text files

- Facilities supporting prepress production workflows (14.11, "Prepress
  Support"), such as the specification of *page boundaries* and the
  generation of *printer's marks*, *colour separations*, *output
  intents*, *traps*, and low-resolution *proxies* for high-resolution
  images

### 14.2 Procedure Sets

The PDF operators used in content streams are grouped into categories of
related operators called *procedure sets* (see Table 314). Each
procedure set corresponds to a named resource containing the
implementations of the operators in that procedure set. The **ProcSet**
entry in a content stream's resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, "Resource
Dictionaries") shall hold an array consisting of the names of the
procedure sets used in that content stream. These procedure sets shall
be used only when the content stream is printed to a PostScript output
device. The names identify PostScript procedure sets that shall be sent
to the device to interpret the PDF operators in the content stream. Each
element of this array shall be one of the predefined names shown in
Table 314.

> **Table 314 -- Predefined procedure set**

  -----------------------------------------------
  **Name**     **Category of operators**
  ------------ ----------------------------------
  **PDF**      Painting and graphics state

  **Text**     Text

  **ImageB**   Grayscale images or image masks
  -----------------------------------------------

> **Table 314 -- Predefined procedure set (continued)**

  -----------------------------------------------
  **Name**     **Category of operators**
  ------------ ----------------------------------
  **ImageC**   Colour images

  **ImageI**   Indexed (colour-table) images
  -----------------------------------------------

Beginning with PDF 1.4, this feature is considered obsolete. For
compatibility with existing conforming readers, conforming writers
should continue to specify procedure sets (preferably, all of those
listed in Table 314 unless it is known that fewer are needed). However,
conforming readers should not depend on the correctness of this
information.

### 14.3 Metadata

**14.3.1 General**

A PDF document may include general information, such as the document's
title, author, and creation and modification dates. Such global
information about the document (as opposed to its content or structure)
is called *metadata* and is intended to assist in cataloguing and
searching for documents in external databases. Beginning with PDF 1.4,
metadata may also be specified for individual components of a document.

Metadata may be stored in a PDF document in either of the following
ways:

- In a *metadata stream (PDF 1.4)* associated with the document or a
  component of the document (14.3.2, "Metadata Streams")

- In a *document information dictionary* associated with the document
  (14.3.3, "Document Information Dictionary")

NOTE Document information dictionaries is the original way that metadata
was included in a PDF file. Metadata streams were introduced in PDF 1.4
and is now the preferred method to include metadata.

**14.3.2 Metadata Streams**

Metadata, both for an entire document and for components within a
document, may be stored in PDF streams called *metadata streams (PDF
1.4)*.

NOTE 1 Metadata streams have the following advantages over the document
information dictionary:

- PDF-based workflows often embed metadata-bearing artwork as components
  within larger documents. Metadata streams provide a standard way of
  preserving the metadata of these components for examination
  downstream. PDF-aware conforming products should be able to derive a
  list of all metadatabearing document components from the PDF document
  itself.

- PDF documents are often made available on the Web or in other
  environments, where many tools routinely examine, catalogue, and
  classify documents. These tools should be able to understand the
  self-contained description of the document even if they do not
  understand PDF.

Besides the usual entries common to all stream dictionaries (see Table
5), the metadata stream dictionary shall contain the additional entries
listed in Table 315.

The contents of a metadata stream shall be the metadata represented in
Extensible Markup Language (XML).

NOTE 2 This information is visible as plain text to tools that are not
PDF-aware only if the metadata stream is both unfiltered and
unencrypted.

> **Table 315 -- Additional entries in a metadata stream dictionary**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**       **Type**   **Value**
  ------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------
  **Type**      name       *(Required)* The type of PDF object that
                           this dictionary describes; shall be
                           **Metadata** for a metadata stream.

  **Subtype**   name       *(Required)* The type of metadata stream
                           that this dictionary describes; shall be
                           **XML**.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 3 The format of the XML representing the metadata is defined as
part of a framework called the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) and
described in the Adobe document *XMP: Extensible Metadata Platform* (see
the Bibliography). This framework provides a way to use XML to represent
metadata describing documents and their components and is intended to be
adopted by a wider class of products than just those that process PDF.
It includes a method to embed XML data within non-XML data files in a
platform-independent format that can be easily located and accessed by
simple scanning rather than requiring the document file to be parsed.

A metadata stream may be attached to a document through the **Metadata**
entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2, "Document Catalog"). The
metadata framework provides a date stamp for metadata expressed in the
framework. If this date stamp is equal to or later than the document
modification date recorded in the document information dictionary, the
metadata stream shall be taken as authoritative. If, however, the
document modification date recorded in the document information
dictionary is later than the metadata stream's date stamp, the document
has likely been saved by a writer that is not aware of metadata streams.
In this case, information stored in the document information dictionary
shall be taken to override any semantically equivalent items in the
metadata stream. In addition, PDF document components represented as a
stream or dictionary may have a **Metadata** entry (see Table 316).

> **Table 316 -- Additional entry for components having metadata**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**        **Type**   **Value**
  -------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------
  **Metadata**   stream     *(Optional; PDF 1.4)* A metadata stream
                            containing metadata for the component.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, any PDF stream or dictionary may have metadata attached to
it as long as the stream or dictionary represents an actual information
resource, as opposed to serving as an implementation artifact. Some PDF
constructs are considered implementational, and hence may not have
associated metadata.

When there is ambiguity about exactly which stream or dictionary may
bear the **Metadata** entry, the metadata shall be attached as close as
possible to the object that actually stores the data resource described.

NOTE 4 Metadata describing a tiling pattern should be attached to the
pattern stream's dictionary, but a shading should have metadata attached
to the shading dictionary rather than to the shading pattern dictionary
that refers to it. Similarly, metadata describing an **ICCBased** colour
space should be attached to the ICC profile stream describing it, and
metadata for fonts should be attached to font file streams rather than
to font dictionaries.

NOTE 5 In tables describing document components in this specification,
the **Metadata** entry is listed only for those in which it is most
likely to be used. Keep in mind, however, that this entry may appear in
other components represented as streams or dictionaries.

• In addition, metadata may also be associated with marked content
within a content stream. This association shall be created by including
an entry in the property list dictionary whose key shall be **Metadata**
and whose value shall be the metadata stream dictionary. Because this
construct refers to an object outside the content stream, the property
list is referred to indirectly as a named resource (see 14.6.2,
"Property Lists").

**14.3.3 Document Information Dictionary**

The optional **Info** entry in the trailer of a PDF file (see 7.5.5,
"File Trailer") shall hold a *document information dictionary*
containing metadata for the document; Table 317 shows its contents. Any
entry whose value is not known should be omitted from the dictionary
rather than included with an empty string as its value.

Some conforming readers may choose to permit searches on the contents of
the document information dictionary. To facilitate browsing and editing,
all keys in the dictionary shall be fully spelled out, not abbreviated.
New keys should be chosen with care so that they make sense to users.

The value associated with any key not specifically mentioned in Table
317 shall be a text string.

Although conforming readers may store custom metadata in the document
information dictionary, they may not store private content or structural
information there. Such information shall be stored in the document
catalogue instead (see 7.7.2, "Document Catalog").

### 14.4 File Identifiers

PDF files may contain references to other PDF files (see 7.11, "File
Specifications"). Simply storing a file name, however, even in a
platform-independent format, does not guarantee that the file can be
found. Even if the file still exists and its name has not been changed,
different server software applications may identify it in different
ways. Servers running on DOS platforms convert all file names to 8
characters and a 3-character extension. Different servers may use
different strategies for converting longer file names to this format.

External file references may be made more reliable by including a *file
identifier (PDF 1.1)* in the file and using it in addition to the normal
platform-based file designation. Matching the identifier in the file
reference with the one in the file confirms whether the correct file was
found.

File identifiers shall be defined by the optional **ID** entry in a PDF
file's trailer dictionary (see 7.5.5, "File Trailer"). The ID entry is
optional but should be used. The value of this entry shall be an array
of two byte strings. The first byte string shall be a permanent
identifier based on the contents of the file at the time it was
originally created and shall not change when the file is incrementally
updated. The second byte string shall be a changing identifier based on
the file's contents at the time it was last updated. When a file is
first written, both identifiers shall be set to the same value. If both
identifiers match when a file reference is resolved, it is very likely
that the correct and unchanged file has been found. If only the first
identifier matches, a different version of the correct file has been
found.

To help ensure the uniqueness of file identifiers, they should be
computed by means of a message digest algorithm such as MD5 (described
in Internet RFC 1321, *The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm*; see the
Bibliography), using the following information:

- The current time

- A string representation of the file's location, usually a pathname

- The size of the file in bytes

- The values of all entries in the file's document information
  dictionary (see 14.3.3, "Document Information Dictionary")

NOTE The calculation of the file identifier need not be reproducible;
all that matters is that the identifier is likely to be unique. For
example, two implementations of the preceding algorithm might use
different formats for the current time, causing them to produce
different file identifiers for the same file created at the same time,
but the uniqueness of the identifier is not affected.

### 14.5 Page-Piece Dictionaries

A *page-piece dictionary (PDF 1.3)* may be used to hold private
conforming product data. The data may be associated with a page or form
XObject by means of the optional **PieceInfo** entry in the page object
(see Table 30) or form dictionary (see Table 95). Beginning with PDF
1.4, private data may also be associated with the PDF document by means
of the **PieceInfo** entry in the document catalogue (see Table 28).

NOTE 1 Conforming products may use this dictionary as a place to store
private data in connection with that document, page, or form. Such
private data can convey information meaningful to the conforming product
that produces it (such as information on object grouping for a graphics
editor or the layer information used by Adobe Photoshop®) but may be
ignored by general-purpose conforming readers.

As Table 318 shows, a page-piece dictionary may contain any number of
entries, each keyed by the name of a distinct conforming product or of a
well-known data type recognized by a family of conforming products. The
value associated with each key shall be a *data dictionary* containing
the private data that shall be used by the conforming product. The
**Private** entry may have a value of any data type, but typically it is
a dictionary containing all of the private data needed by the conforming
product other than the actual content of the document, page, or form.

  **LastModified**   date       *(Required)* The date and time when
                                the contents of the document, page,
                                or form were most recently modified
                                by this conforming product.

  **Private**        (any)      *(Optional)* Any private data
                                appropriate to the conforming
                                product, typically in the form of a
                                dictionary.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

The **LastModified** entry indicates when this conforming product last
altered the content of the page or form. If the page-piece dictionary
contains several data dictionaries, their modification dates can be
compared with those in the corresponding entry of the page object or
form dictionary (see Table 30 and Table 95), or the **ModDate** entry of
the document information dictionary (see Table 317), to ascertain which
data dictionary corresponds to the current content of the page or form.
Because some platforms may use only an approximate value for the date
and time or may not deal correctly with differing time zones,
modification dates shall be compared only for equality and not for
sequential ordering.

NOTE 2 It is possible for two or more data dictionaries to have the same
modification date. Conforming products can use this capability to define
multiple or extended versions of the same data format. For example,
suppose that earlier versions of a conforming product use an data
dictionary named ***PictureEdit***, and later versions of the same
conforming product extend the data to include additional items not
previously used. The original data could continue to be kept in the
***PictureEdit*** dictionary and the additional items placed in a new
dictionary named ***PictureEditExtended***. This allows the earlier
versions of the conforming product to continue to work as before, and
later versions are able to locate and use the extended data items.

### 14.6 Marked Content

**14.6.1 General**

*Marked-content operators (PDF 1.2)* may identify a portion of a PDF
content stream as a *marked-content element* of interest to a particular
conforming product. Marked-content elements and the operators that mark
them shall fall into two categories:

- The **MP** and **DP** operators shall designate a single
  *marked-content point* in the content stream.

- The **BMC**, **BDC**, and **EMC** operators shall bracket a
  *marked-content sequence* of objects within the content stream.

NOTE 1 This is a sequence not simply of bytes in the content stream but
of complete graphics objects. Each object is fully qualified by the
parameters of the graphics state in which it is rendered.

NOTE 2 A graphics application, for example, might use marked content to
identify a set of related objects as a group to be processed as a single
unit. A text-processing application might use it to maintain a
connection between a footnote marker in the body of a document and the
corresponding footnote text at the bottom of the page. The PDF logical
structure facilities use marked-content sequences to associate graphical
content with structure elements (see 14.7.4, "Structure Content"). Table
320 summarizes the marked-content operators.

All marked-content operators except **EMC** shall take a *tag* operand
indicating the role or significance of the marked-content element to the
conforming reader. All such tags shall be registered with Adobe Systems
(see Annex E) to avoid conflicts between different applications marking
the same content stream. In addition to the tag operand, the **DP** and
**BDC** operators shall specify a *property list* containing further
information associated with the marked content. Property lists are
discussed further in 14.6.2, "Property Lists."

Marked-content operators may appear only *between* graphics objects in
the content stream. They may not occur within a graphics object or
between a graphics state operator and its operands. Marked-content
sequences may be nested one within another, but each sequence shall be
entirely contained within a single content stream.

NOTE 3 A marked-content sequence may not cross page boundaries.

NOTE 4 The ***Contents*** entry of a page object (see 7.7.3.3, "Page
Objects"), which may be either a single stream or an array of streams,
is considered a single stream with respect to marked-content sequences.

|              |              | either an inline dictionary containing |
|              |              | the property list or a name object     |
|              |              | associated with it in the              |
|              |              | **Properties** subdictionary of the    |
|              |              | current resource dictionary (see       |

+--------------+--------------+----------------------------------------+

When the marked-content operators **BMC**, **BDC**, and **EMC** are
combined with the text object operators **BT** and **ET** (see 9.4,
"Text Objects"), each pair of matching operators (**BMC** ... **EMC**,
**BDC** ... **EMC**, or **BT** ... **ET**) shall be properly
(separately) nested. Therefore, the sequences

| BMC              |          | BT   |
+:================:+:=========+=====:+
| > BT             |          | BMC  |

| > ET             |          | EMC  |
+------------------+----------+------+
| EMC              |          | ET   |
|                  |          |      |
| are valid, but   |          |      |

+------------------+----------+------+
| > BT             |          | EMC  |
+------------------+----------+------+

are not valid.

**14.6.2 Property Lists**

The marked-content operators **DP** and **BDC** associate a *property
list* with a marked-content element within a content stream. The
property list is a dictionary containing private information meaningful
to the conforming writer creating the marked content. Conforming
products should use the dictionary entries in a consistent way; the
values associated with a given key should always be of the same type (or
small set of types).

If all of the values in a property list dictionary are direct objects,
the dictionary may be written inline in the content stream as a direct
object. If any of the values are indirect references to objects outside
the content stream, the property list dictionary shall be defined as a
named resource in the **Properties** subdictionary of the current
resource dictionary (see 7.8.3, "Resource Dictionaries") and referenced
by name as the *properties* operand of the **DP** or **BDC** operator.

**14.6.3 Marked Content and Clipping**

Some PDF path and text objects are defined purely for their effect on
the current clipping path, without the objects actually being painted on
the page. This occurs when a path object is defined using the operator
sequence **W n** or **W\* n** (see 8.5.4, "Clipping Path Operators") or
when a text object is painted in text rendering mode 7 (see 9.3.6, "Text
Rendering Mode"). Such clipped, unpainted path or text objects are
called *clipping objects*. When a clipping object falls within a
marked-content sequence, it shall not be considered part of the sequence
unless the entire sequence consists only of clipping objects. In Example
1, for instance, the markedcontent sequence tagged *Clip* includes the
text string ( Clip me ) but not the rectangular path that defines the
clipping boundary.

EXAMPLE 1 /Clip BMC

100 100 10 10 re W n % Clipping path

> ( Clip me ) Tj % Object to be clipped EMC

Only when a marked-content sequence consists entirely of clipping
objects shall the clipping objects be considered part of the sequence.
In this case, the sequence is known as a *marked clipping sequence*.
Such sequences may be nested. In Example 2, for instance, multiple lines
of text are used to clip a subsequent graphics object (in this case, a
filled path). Each line of text shall be bracketed within a separate
marked clipping sequence, tagged *Pgf*. The entire series shall be
bracketed in turn by an outer marked clipping sequence, tagged *Clip*.

NOTE The marked-content sequence tagged ClippedText is *not* a marked
clipping sequence, since it contains a filled rectangular path that is
not a clipping object. The clipping objects belonging to the Clip and
Pgf sequences are therefore not considered part of the ClippedText
sequence.

The precise rules governing marked clipping sequences shall be as
follows:

- A *clipping object* shall be a path object ended by the operator
  sequence **W n** or **W\* n** or a text object painted in text
  rendering mode 7.

- An *invisible graphics object* shall be a path object ended by the
  operator **n** only (with no preceding **W** or **W\***) or a text
  object painted in text rendering mode 3.

- A *visible graphics object* shall be a path object ended by any
  operator other than **n**, a text object painted in any text rendering
  mode other than 3 or 7, or any XObject invoked by the **Do** operator.

- An *empty marked-content element* shall be a marked-content point or a
  marked-content sequence that encloses no graphics objects.

- A *marked clipping sequence* shall be a marked-content sequence that
  contains at least one clipping object and no visible graphics objects.

- Clipping objects and marked clipping sequences shall be considered
  part of an enclosing marked-content sequence only if it is a marked
  clipping sequence.

- Invisible graphics objects and empty marked-content elements shall
  always be considered part of an enclosing marked-content sequence,
  regardless of whether it is a marked clipping sequence.

- The **q** (save) and **Q** (restore) operators may not occur within a
  marked clipping sequence.

Example 3 illustrates the application of these rules. Marked-content
sequence S4 is a marked clipping sequence because it contains a clipping
object (clipping path 2) and no visible graphics objects. Clipping path
2 is therefore considered part of sequence S4. Marked-content sequences
S1, S2, and S3 are *not* marked clipping sequences, since they each
include at least one visible graphics object. Thus, clipping paths 1 and
2 are not part of any of these three sequences.

In Example 4 marked-content sequence S1 is a marked clipping sequence
because the only graphics object it contains is a clipping path. Thus,
the empty marked-content sequence S3 and the marked-content point P1 are
both part of sequence S2, and S2, S3, and P1 are all part of sequence
S1.

In Example 5 marked-content sequences S1 and S4 are marked clipping
sequences because the only object they contain is a clipping path. Hence
the clipping path is part of sequences S1 and S4; S3 is part of S2; and
S2, S3, and S4 are all part of S1.

### 14.7 Logical Structure

**14.7.1 General**

PDF's *logical structure* facilities *(PDF 1.3)* shall provide a
mechanism for incorporating structural information about a document's
content into a PDF file. Such information may include the organization
of the document into chapters and sections or the identification of
special elements such as figures, tables, and footnotes. The logical
structure facilities shall be extensible, allowing conforming writers to
choose what structural information to include and how to represent it,
while enabling conforming readers to navigate a file without knowing the
producer's structural conventions.

PDF logical structure shares basic features with standard document
markup languages such as HTML, SGML, and XML. A document's logical
structure shall be expressed as a hierarchy of *structure elements*,
each represented by a dictionary object. Like their counterparts in
other markup languages, PDF structure elements may have content and
attributes. In PDF, rendered document content takes over the role
occupied by text in HTML, SGML, and XML.

A PDF document's logical structure shall be stored separately from its
visible content, with pointers from each to the other. This separation
allows the ordering and nesting of logical elements to be entirely
independent of the order and location of graphics objects on the
document's pages.

The **Markings** entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2, "Document
Catalog") shall specify a *mark information dictionary*, whose entries
are shown in Table 321. It provides additional information relevant to
specialized uses of structured PDF documents.

> **Table 321 -- Entries in the mark information dictionary**

+--------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+

| **Marked**         | boolean  | *(Optional)* A flag indicating whether |
|                    |          | the document conforms to Tagged PDF    |
|                    |          | conventions (see 14.8, "Tagged PDF").  |
|                    |          | Default value: **false**.              |
|                    |          |                                        |

|                    |          | document may not completely conform to |
|                    |          | Tagged PDF conventions.                |
+--------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| **UserProperties** | boolean  | *(Optional; PDF 1.6)* A flag           |
|                    |          | indicating the presence of structure   |
|                    |          | elements that contain user properties  |
|                    |          | attributes (see 14.7.5.4, "User        |
|                    |          | Properties"). Default value:           |
|                    |          | **false**.                             |
+--------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| **Suspects**       | boolean  | *(Optional; PDF 1.6)* A flag           |
|                    |          | indicating the presence of tag         |
|                    |          | suspects (see 14.8.2.3, "Page Content  |
|                    |          | Order"). Default value: **false**.     |
+--------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+

**14.7.2 Structure Hierarchy**

The logical structure of a document shall be described by a hierarchy of
objects called the *structure hierarchy* or *structure tree*. At the
root of the hierarchy shall be a dictionary object called the *structure
tree root*, located by means of the **StructTreeRoot** entry in the
document catalogue (see 7.7.2, "Document Catalog"). Table 322 shows the
entries in the structure tree root dictionary. The **K** entry shall
specify the immediate children of the structure tree root, which shall
be *structure elements*.

Structure elements shall be represented by a dictionary, whose entries
are shown in Table 323. The **K** entry shall specify the children of
the structure element, which may be zero or more items of the following
kinds:

- Other structure elements

- References to *content items*, which are either marked-content
  sequences (see 14.6, "Marked Content") or complete PDF objects such as
  XObjects and annotations. These content items represent the graphical
  content, if any, associated with a structure element. Content items
  are discussed in detail in 14.7.4,

                               representing it in human-readable
                               form. The title should characterize
                               the specific structure element, such
                               as Chapter 1, rather than merely a
                               generic element type, such as
                               Chapter.

  **Lang**         text string *(Optional; PDF 1.4)* A language
                               identifier specifying the natural
                               language for all text in the
                               structure element except where
                               overridden by language specifications
                               for nested structure elements or
                               marked content (see 14.9.2, "Natural
                               Language Specification"). If this
                               entry is absent, the language (if
                               any) specified in the document
                               catalogue applies.

  **Alt**          text string *(Optional)* An alternate description

                               children in human-readable form,
                               which is useful when extracting the
                               document's contents in support of
                               accessibility to users with
                               disabilities or for other purposes
                               (see 14.9.3, "Alternate

  **E**            text string *(Optional; PDF 1.5)* The expanded
                               form of an abbreviation.

  **ActualText**   text string *(Optional; PDF 1.4)* Text that is an

                               element and its children. This
                               replacement text (which should apply
                               to as small a piece of content as
                               possible) is useful when extracting
                               the document's contents in support of
                               accessibility to users with
                               disabilities or for other purposes
                               (see 14.9.4, "Replacement Text").
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

**14.7.3 Structure Types**

Every structure element shall have a *structure type*, a name object
that identifies the nature of the structure element and its role within
the document (such as a chapter, paragraph, or footnote). To facilitate
the interchange of content among conforming products, PDF defines a set
of standard structure types; see 14.8.4, "Standard Structure Types."
Conforming products are not required to adopt them, however, and may use
any names for their structure types.

Where names other than the standard ones are used, a *role map* may be
provided in the structure tree root, mapping the structure types used in
the document to their nearest equivalents in the standard set.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 1 A structure type named Section used in the document might
         be mapped to the standard type Sect. The equivalence need
         not be exact; the role map merely indicates an approximate
         analogy between types, allowing conforming products to
         share nonstandard structure elements in a reasonable way.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 The same structure type may occur as both a key and a value
         in the role map, and circular chains of association are
         explicitly permitted. Therefore, a single role map may
         define a bidirectional mapping. A conforming reader using
         the role map should follow the chain of associations until
         it either finds a structure type it recognizes or returns
         to one it has already encountered.

  NOTE 3 In PDF versions earlier than 1.5, standard element types
         were never remapped. Beginning with PDF 1.5, an element
         name shall always be mapped to its corresponding name in
         the role map, if there is one, even if the original name is
         one of the standard types. This shall be done to allow the
         element, for example, to represent a tag with the same name
         as a standard role, even though its use differs from the
         standard role.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

**14.7.4 Structure Content**

**14.7.4.1 General**

Any structure element may have associated graphical content, consisting
of one or more *content items*. Content items shall be graphical objects
that exist in the document independently of the structure tree but are
associated with structure elements as described in the following
sub-clauses. Content items are of two kinds:

- Marked-content sequences within content streams (see 14.7.4.2,
  "Marked-Content Sequences as Content Items")

- Complete PDF objects such as annotations and XObjects (see 14.7.4.3,
  "PDF Objects as Content Items")

The **K** entry in a structure element dictionary (see Table 323) shall
specify the children of the structure element, which may include any
number of content items, as well as child structure elements that may in
turn have content items of their own.

Content items shall be leaf nodes of the structure tree; that is, they
may not have other content items nested within them for purposes of
logical structure. The hierarchical relationship among structure
elements shall be represented entirely by the **K** entries of the
structure element dictionaries, not by nesting of the associated content
items. Therefore, the following restrictions shall apply:

- A marked-content sequence delimiting a structure content item may not
  have another marked-content sequence for a content item nested within
  it though non-structural marked content shall be allowed.

- A structure content item shall not invoke (with the **Do** operator)
  an XObject that is itself a structure content item.

**14.7.4.2 Marked-Content Sequences as Content Items**

A sequence of graphics operators in a content stream may be specified as
a content item of a structure element in the following way:

- The operators shall be bracketed as a marked-content sequence between
  **BDC** and **EMC** operators (see 14.6, "Marked Content"). Although
  the tag associated with a marked-content sequence is not directly
  related to the document's logical structure, it should be the same as
  the structure type of the associated structure element.

- The marked-content sequence shall have a property list (see 14.6.2,
  "Property Lists") containing an **MCID** entry, which i shall be an
  integer *marked-content identifier* that uniquely identifies the
  marked-content sequence within its content stream, as shown in the
  following example:

NOTE This example and the following examples omit required
***StructParents*** entries in the objects used as content items (see
14.7.4.4, "Finding Structure Elements from Content Items").

A structure element dictionary may include one or more marked-content
sequences as content items by referring to them in its **K** entry (see
Table 323). This reference may have two forms:

- A dictionary object called a *marked-content reference.* Table 324
  shows the contents of this type of dictionary, which shall specify the
  marked-content identifier, as well other information identifying the
  stream in which the sequence is contained. Example 2 illustrates the
  use of a marked-content reference to the marked-content sequence shown
  in Example 3.

- An integer that specifies the marked-content identifier. This may be
  done in the common case where the marked-content sequence is contained
  in the content stream of the page that is specified in the **Pg**
  entry of the structure element dictionary. Example 3 shows a structure
  element that has three children: a markedcontent sequence specified by
  a marked-content identifier, as well as two other structure elements.

Content streams other than page contents may also contain marked content
sequences that are content items of structure elements. The content of
form XObjects may be incorporated into structure elements in one of the
following ways:

- A **Do** operator that paints a form XObject may be part of a
  marked-content sequence that shall be associated with a structure
  element (see Example 4). In this case, the entire form XObject shall
  be considered to be part of the structure element's content, as if it
  were inserted into the marked-content sequence at the point of the
  **Do** operator. The form XObject shall not in turn contain any
  marked-content sequences associated with this or other structure
  elements.

- The content stream of a form XObject may contain one or more
  marked-content sequences that shall be associated with structure
  elements (see Example 5). The form XObject may have arbitrary
  substructure, containing any number of marked-content sequences
  associated with logical structure elements. However, any **Do**
  operator that paints the form XObject should not be part of a logical
  structure content item.

A form XObject that is painted with multiple invocations of the **Do**
operator may be incorporated into the document's logical structure only
by the first method, with each invocation of **Do** individually
associated with a structure element.

**14.7.4.3 PDF Objects as Content Items**

When a structure element's content includes an entire PDF object, such
as an XObject or an annotation, that is associated with a page but not
directly included in the page's content stream, the object shall be
identified in the structure element's **K** entry by an *object
reference dictionary* (see Table 325).

NOTE 1 This form of reference is used only for entire objects. If the
referenced content forms only part of the object's content stream, it is
instead handled as a marked-content sequence, as described in the
preceding subclause.

> **Table 325 -- Entries in an object reference dictionary**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**     **Value**
  ---------- ------------ --------------------------------------------
  **Type**   name         *(Required)* The type of PDF object that
                          this dictionary describes; shall be **OBJR**
                          for an object reference.

  **Pg**     dictionary   *(Optional; shall be an indirect reference*)
                          The page object of the page on which the
                          object shall be rendered. This entry
                          overrides any **Pg** entry in the structure
                          element containing the object reference; it
                          shall be used if the structure element has
                          no such entry.

  **Obj**    (any)        *(Required; shall be an indirect reference*)
                          The referenced object.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 If the referenced object is rendered on multiple pages, each
rendering requires a separate object reference. However, if it is
rendered multiple times on the same page, just a single object reference
suffices to identify all of them. (If it is important to distinguish
between multiple renditions of the same XObject on the same page, they
should be accessed by means of marked-content sequences enclosing
particular invocations of the **Do** operator rather than through object
references.)

**14.7.4.4 Finding Structure Elements from Content Items**

Because a stream may not contain object references, there is no way for
content items that are marked-content sequences to refer directly back
to their parent structure elements (the ones to which they belong as
content items). Instead, a different mechanism, the *structural parent
tree*, shall be provided for this purpose. For consistency, content
items that are entire PDF objects, such as XObjects, also shall use the
parent tree to refer to their parent structure elements.

The parent tree is a number tree (see 7.9.7, "Number Trees"), accessed
from the **ParentTree** entry in a document's structure tree root (Table
322). The tree shall contain an entry for each object that is a content
item of at least one structure element and for each content stream
containing at least one marked-content sequence that is a content item.
The key for each entry shall be an integer given as the value of the
**StructParent** or **StructParents** entry in the object (see Table
326). The values of these entries shall be as follows:

- For an object identified as a content item by means of an object
  reference (see 14.7.4.3, "PDF Objects as Content Items"), the value
  shall be an indirect reference to the parent structure element.

- For a content stream containing marked-content sequences that are
  content items, the value shall be an array of indirect references to
  the sequences' parent structure elements. The array element
  corresponding to each sequence shall be found by using the sequence's
  marked-content identifier as a zero-based index into the array.

NOTE Because marked-content identifiers serve as indices into an array
in the structural parent tree, their assigned values should be as small
as possible to conserve space in the array.

The **ParentTreeNextKey** entry in the structure tree root shall hold an
integer value greater than any that is currently in use as a key in the
structural parent tree. Whenever a new entry is added to the parent
tree, the current value of **ParentTreeNextKey** shall be used as its
key. The value shall be then incremented to prepare for the next new
entry to be added.

To locate the relevant parent tree entry, each object or content stream
that is represented in the tree shall contain a special dictionary
entry, **StructParent** or **StructParents** (see Table 326). Depending
on the type of content item, this entry may appear in the page object of
a page containing marked-content sequences, in the stream dictionary of
a form or image XObject, in an annotation dictionary, or in any other
type of object dictionary that is included as a content item in a
structure element. Its value shall be the integer key under which the
entry corresponding to the object shall be found in the structural
parent tree.

|                   |          | At most one of these two entries shall |
|                   |          | be present in a given object. An       |
|                   |          | object may be either a content item in |
|                   |          | its entirety or a container for        |
|                   |          | marked-content sequences that are      |
|                   |          | content items, but not both.           |
+-------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+

For a content item identified by an object reference, the parent
structure element may be found by using the value of the
**StructParent** entry in the item's object dictionary as a retrieval
key in the structural parent tree (found in the **ParentTree** entry of
the structure tree root). The corresponding value in the parent tree
shall be a reference to the parent structure element (see Example 1).

For a content item that is a marked-content sequence, the retrieval
method is similar but slightly more complicated. Because a
marked-content sequence is not an object in its own right, its parent
tree key shall be found in the **StructParents** entry of the page
object or other content stream in which the sequence resides. The value
retrieved from the parent tree shall not be a reference to the parent
structure element itself but to an array of such references---one for
each marked-content sequence contained within that content stream. The
parent structure element for the given sequence shall be found by using
the sequence's marked-content identifier as an index into this array
(see Example 2).

**14.7.5 Structure Attributes**

**14.7.5.1 General**

A conforming product that processes logical structure may attach
additional information, called *attributes*, to any structure element.
The attribute information shall be held in one or more *attribute
objects* associated with the structure element. An attribute object
shall be a dictionary or stream that includes an **O** entry (see Table
327) identifying the conforming product that owns the attribute
information. Other entries shall represent the attributes: the keys
shall be attribute names, and values shall be the corresponding
attribute values. To facilitate the interchange of content among
conforming products, PDF defines a set of standard structure attributes
identified by specific standard owners; see 14.8.5, "Standard Structure
Attributes." In addition, *(PDF 1.6)* attributes may be used to
represent user properties (see 14.7.5.4, "User Properties").

> **Table 327 -- Entry common to all attribute object dictionaries**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**   **Value**
  --------- ---------- ----------------------------------------------
  **O**     name       *(Required)* The name of the conforming
                       product owning the attribute data. The name
                       shall conform to the guidelines described in
                       Annex E.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

Any conforming product may attach attributes to any structure element,
even one created by another conforming product. Multiple conforming
products may attach attributes to the same structure element. The **A**
entry in the structure element dictionary (see Table 323) shall hold
either a single attribute object or an array of such objects, together
with *revision numbers* for coordinating attributes created by different
conforming products (see 14.7.5.3, "Attribute Revision Numbers"). A
conforming product creating or destroying the second attribute object
for a structure element shall be responsible for converting the value of
the **A** entry from a single object to an array or vice versa, as well
as for maintaining the integrity of the revision numbers. No inherent
order shall be defined for the attribute objects in an **A** array, but
new objects should be added at the end of the array so that the first
array element is the one belonging to the conforming product that
originally created the structure element.

**14.7.5.2 Attribute Classes**

If many structure elements share the same set of attribute values, they
may be defined as an *attribute class* sharing the identical attribute
object. Structure elements shall refer to the class by name. The
association between class names and attribute objects shall be defined
by a dictionary called the *class map*, that shall be kept in the
**ClassMap** entry of the structure tree root (see Table 322). Each key
in the class map shall be a name object denoting the name of a class.
The corresponding value shall be an attribute object or an array of such
objects.

NOTE PDF attribute classes are unrelated to the concept of a class in
object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C++. Attribute
classes are strictly a mechanism for storing attribute information in a
more compact form; they have no inheritance properties like those of
true object-oriented classes.

The **C** entry in a structure element dictionary (see Table 323) shall
contain a class name or an array of class names (typically accompanied
by revision numbers as well; see 14.7.5.3, "Attribute Revision
Numbers"). For each class named in the **C** entry, the corresponding
attribute object or objects shall be considered to be attached to the
given structure element, along with those identified in the element's
**A** entry. If both the **A** and **C** entries are present and a given
attribute is specified by both, the one specified by the **A** entry
shall take precedence.

**14.7.5.3 Attribute Revision Numbers**

When a conforming product modifies a structure element or its contents,
the change may affect the validity of attribute information attached to
that structure element by other conforming products. A system of
*revision numbers* shall allow conforming products to detect such
changes and update their own attribute information accordingly, as
described in this sub-clause.

A structure element shall have a revision number, that shall be stored
in the **R** entry in the structure element dictionary (see Table 323)
or default to 0 if no **R** entry is present. Initially, the revision
number shall be 0. When a conforming product modifies the structure
element or any of its content items, it may signal the change by
incrementing the revision number.

NOTE 1 The revision number is unrelated to the generation number
associated with an indirect object (see 7.3.10, "Indirect Objects").

NOTE 2 If their is no R entry and the revision number is to be
incremented from the default value of 0 to 1, an R entry must be created
in the structure element dictionary in order to record the 1.

Each attribute object attached to a structure element shall have an
associated revision number. The revision number shall be stored in the
array that associates the attribute object with the structure element or
if not stored in the array that associates the attribute object with the
structure element shall default to 0.

- Each attribute object in a structure element's **A** array shall be
  represented by a single or a pair of array elements, the first or only
  element shall contain the attribute object itself and the second (when
  present) shall contain the integer revision number associated with it
  in this structure element.

- The structure element's **C** array shall contain a single or a pair
  of elements for each attribute class, the first or only shall contain
  the class name and the second (when present) shall contain the
  associated revision number.

The revision numbers are optional in both the **A** and **C** arrays. An
attribute object or class name that is not followed by an integer array
element shall have a revision number of 0 and is represented by a single
entry in the array.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 3 The revision number is not stored directly in the attribute
         object because a single attribute object may be associated
         with more than one structure element (whose revision
         numbers may differ). Since an attribute object reference is
         distinct from an integer, that distinction is used to
         determine whether the attribute object is represented in
         the array by a single or a pair of entries.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 4 When an attribute object is created or modified, its
         revision number is set to the current value of the
         structure element's **R** entry. By comparing the attribute
         object's revision number with that of the structure
         element, an application can determine whether the contents
         of the attribute object are still current or whether they
         have been outdated by more recent changes in the underlying
         structure element.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in an attribute object shall not change the revision number of
the associated structure element, which shall change only when the
structure element itself or any of its content items is modified.

Occasionally, a conforming product may make extensive changes to a
structure element that are likely to invalidate all previous attribute
information associated with it. In this case, instead of incrementing
the structure element's revision number, the conforming product may
choose to delete all unknown attribute objects from its **A** and **C**
arrays. These two actions shall be mutually exclusive: the conforming
product should *either* increment the structure element's revision
number *or* remove its attribute objects, but not both.

NOTE 5 Any conforming product creating attribute objects needs to be
prepared for the possibility that they can be deleted at any time by
another conforming product.

**14.7.5.4 User Properties**

Most structure attributes (see 14.8.5, "Standard Structure Attributes")
specify information that is reflected in the element's appearance; for
example, **BackgroundColor** or **BorderStyle**.

Some conforming writers, such as CAD applications, may use objects that
have a standardized appearance, each of which contains non-graphical
information that distinguishes the objects from one another. For
example, several transistors might have the same appearance but
different attributes such as type and part number.

*User properties (PDF 1.6)* may be used to contain such information. Any
graphical object that corresponds to a structure element may have
associated user properties, specified by means of an attribute object
dictionary that shall have a value of **UserProperties** for the **O**
entry (see Table 328).

> **Table 328 -- Additional entries in an attribute object dictionary
> for user properties**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**   **Value**
  --------- ---------- ----------------------------------------------
  **O**     name       *(Required)* The attribute owner. Shall be
                       **UserProperties**.

  **P**     array      *(Required)* An array of dictionaries, each of
                       which represents a user property (see Table
                       329).
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

The **P** entry shall be an array specifying the user properties. Each
element in the array shall be a *user property dictionary* representing
an individual property (see Table 329). The order of the array elements
shall specify attributes in order of importance.

> **Table 329 -- Entries in a user property dictionary**

|         |          | While the value of this entry shall be any  |
|         |          | type of PDF object, conforming writers      |
|         |          | should use only text string, number, and    |
|         |          | boolean values. Conforming readers should   |
|         |          | display text, number and boolean values to  |
|         |          | users but need not display values of other  |
|         |          | types; however, they should not treat other |
|         |          | values as errors.                           |
+---------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| **F**   | text     | *(Optional)* A formatted representation of  |
|         | string   | the value of **V**, that shall be used for  |
|         |          | special formatting; for example             |
|         |          | "(\$123.45)" for the number -123.45. If     |
|         |          | this entry is absent, conforming readers    |
|         |          | should use a default format.                |
+---------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| **H**   | boolean  | *(Optional)* If **true**, the attribute     |
|         |          | shall be hidden; that is, it shall not be   |
|         |          | shown in any user interface element that    |
|         |          | presents the attributes of an object.       |
|         |          | Default value: **false**.                   |
+---------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

PDF documents that contain user properties shall provide a
**UserProperties** entry with a value of **true** in the document's mark
information dictionary (see Table 321). This entry allows conforming
readers to quickly determine whether it is necessary to search the
structure tree for elements containing user properties.

EXAMPLE The following example shows a structure element containing user
properties called Part Name, Part Number, Supplier, and Price.

**14.7.6 Example of Logical Structure**

The next Example shows portions of a PDF file with a simple document
structure. The structure tree root (object 300) contains elements with
structure types **Chap** (object 301) and **Para** (object 304). The
**Chap** element, titled Chapter 1, contains elements with types
**Head1** (object 302) and **Para** (object 303).

These elements are mapped to the standard structure types specified in
Tagged PDF (see 14.8.4, "Standard Structure Types") by means of the role
map specified in the structure tree root. Objects 302 through 304 have
attached attributes (see 14.7.5, "Structure Attributes," and 14.8.5,
"Standard Structure Attributes").

The example also illustrates the structure of a parent tree (object 400)
that maps content items back to their parent structure elements and an
ID tree (object 403) that maps element identifiers to the structure
elements they denote.

### 14.8 Tagged PDF

**14.8.1 General**

*Tagged PDF (PDF 1.4)* is a stylized use of PDF that builds on the
logical structure framework described in 14.7, "Logical Structure." It
defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page
content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for
other purposes. A tagged PDF document is one that conforms to the rules
described in this sub-clause. A conforming writer is not required to
produce tagged PDF documents; however, if it does, it shall conform to
these rules.

NOTE 1 It is intended for use by tools that perform the following types
of operations:

- Simple extraction of text and graphics for pasting into other
  applications

- Automatic reflow of text and associated graphics to fit a page of a
  different size than was assumed for the original layout

- Processing text for such purposes as searching, indexing, and
  spell-checking

- Conversion to other common file formats (such as HTML, XML, and RTF)
  with document structure and basic styling information preserved

- Making content accessible to users with visual impairments (see 14.9,
  "Accessibility Support")

A tagged PDF document shall conform to the following rules:

- *Page content* (14.8.2, "Tagged PDF and Page Content"). Tagged PDF
  defines a set of rules for representing text in the page content so
  that characters, words, and text order can be determined reliably. All
  text shall be represented in a form that can be converted to Unicode.
  Word breaks shall be represented explicitly. Actual content shall be
  distinguished from artifacts of layout and pagination. Content shall
  be given in an order related to its appearance on the page, as
  determined by the conforming writer.

- A *basic layout model* (14.8.3, "Basic Layout Model"). A set of rules
  for describing the arrangement of structure elements on the page.

- *Structure types* (14.8.4, "Standard Structure Types"). A set of
  standard structure types define the meaning of structure elements,
  such as paragraphs, headings, articles, and tables.

- *Structure attributes* (14.8.5, "Standard Structure Attributes").
  Standard structure attributes preserve styling information used by the
  conforming writer in laying out content on the page.

A Tagged PDF document shall also contain a mark information dictionary
(see Table 321) with a value of **true** for the **Marked** entry.

NOTE 2 The types and attributes defined for Tagged PDF are intended to
provide a set of standard fallback roles and minimum guaranteed
attributes to enable conforming readers to perform operations such as
those mentioned previously. Conforming writers are free to define
additional structure types as long as they also provide a role mapping
to the nearest equivalent standard types, as described in 14.7.3,
"Structure Types." Likewise, conforming writers can define additional
structure attributes using any of the available extension mechanisms.

**14.8.2 Tagged PDF and Page Content**

**14.8.2.1 General**

Like all PDF documents, a Tagged PDF document consists of a sequence of
self-contained pages, each of which shall be described by one or more
page content streams (including any subsidiary streams such as form
XObjects and annotation appearances). Tagged PDF defines some further
rules for organizing and marking content streams so that additional
information can be derived from them:

- Distinguishing between the author's original content and artifacts of
  the layout process (see 14.8.2.2, "Real Content and Artifacts").

- Specifying a content order to guide the layout process if the
  conforming reader reflows the page content (see 14.8.2.3, "Page
  Content Order").

- Representing text in a form from which a Unicode representation and
  information about font characteristics can be unambiguously derived
  (see 14.8.2.4, "Extraction of Character Properties").

- Representing word breaks unambiguously (see 14.8.2.5, "Identifying
  Word Breaks").

- Marking text with information for making it accessible to users with
  visual impairments (see 14.9, "Accessibility Support").

**14.8.2.2 Real Content and Artifacts**

**14.8.2.2.1 General**

The graphics objects in a document can be divided into two classes:

- The *real content* of a document comprises objects representing
  material originally introduced by the document's author.

- *Artifacts* are graphics objects that are not part of the author's
  original content but rather are generated by the conforming writer in
  the course of pagination, layout, or other strictly mechanical
  processes.

NOTE Artifacts may also be used to describe areas of the document where
the author uses a graphical background, with the goal of enhancing the
visual experience. In such a case, the background is not required for
understanding the content.

The document's logical structure encompasses all graphics objects making
up the real content and describes how those objects relate to one
another. It does not include graphics objects that are mere artifacts of
the layout and production process.

A document's real content includes not only the page content stream and
subsidiary form XObjects but also associated annotations that meet all
of the following conditions:

- The annotation has an appearance stream (see 12.5.5, "Appearance
  Streams") containing a normal (**N**) appearance.

- The annotation's Hidden flag (see 12.5.3, "Annotation Flags") is not
  set.

- The annotation is included in the document's logical structure (see
  14.7, "Logical Structure").

**14.8.2.2.2 Specification of Artifacts**

An artifact shall be explicitly distinguished from real content by
enclosing it in a marked-content sequence with the tag Artifact:

+-----------+------------+--------------+
| /Artifact |            | /Artifact    |
|           |            | propertyList |
+:==========+:===========+:=============+
| > BMC     |            | > BDC        |
+-----------+------------+--------------+
| > ...     | > or       | > ...        |
+-----------+------------+--------------+
| > EMC     |            | > EMC        |
+-----------+------------+--------------+

The first form shall be used to identify a generic artifact; the second
shall be used for those that have an associated property list. Table 330
shows the properties that can be included in such a property list.

NOTE 1 To aid in text reflow, artifacts should be defined with property
lists whenever possible. Artifacts lacking a specified bounding box are
likely to be discarded during reflow.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**    **Type**    **Value**
  ---------- ----------- -----------------------------------------
  **Type**   name        *(Optional)* The type of artifact that
                         this property list describes; if present,
                         shall be one of the names **Pagination**,

                         and top edges, respectively, of the
                         artifact's bounding box (the rectangle
                         that completely encloses its visible
                         extent).

+:=============+:=========+========================================+
| **Attached** | array    | *(Optional; pagination and full-page   |
|              |          | background artifacts only)* An array   |
|              |          | of name objects containing one to four |
|              |          | of the names Top, Bottom, Left, and    |
|              |          | Right, specifying the edges of the     |
|              |          | page, if any, to which the artifact is |
|              |          | logically attached. Page edges shall   |
|              |          | be defined by the page's crop box (see |
|              |          | 14.11.2, "Page Boundaries"). The       |
|              |          | ordering of names within the array is  |
|              |          | immaterial. Including both Left and    |
|              |          | Right or both Top and Bottom indicates |
|              |          | a full-width or full-height artifact,  |

+--------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| **Subtype**  | name     | *(Optional; PDF 1.7)* The subtype of   |
|              |          | the artifact. This entry should appear |
|              |          | only when the **Type** entry has a     |
|              |          | value of Pagination. Standard values   |
|              |          | are Header, Footer, and                |
|              |          |                                        |
|              |          | Watermark. Additional values may be    |
|              |          | specified for this entry, provided     |
|              |          | they comply with the naming            |
|              |          | conventions described in Annex E.      |
+--------------+----------+----------------------------------------+

The following types of artifacts can be specified by the **Type** entry:

- *Pagination artifacts*. Ancillary page features such as running heads
  and folios (page numbers).

- *Layout artifacts*. Purely cosmetic typographical or design elements
  such as footnote rules or background screens.

- *Page artifacts*. Production aids extraneous to the document itself,
  such as cut marks and colour bars.

- *Background artifacts*. Images, patterns or coloured blocks that
  either run the entire length and/or width of the page or the entire
  dimensions of a structural element. Background artifacts typically
  serve as a background for content shown either on top of or placed
  adjacent to that background.

A background artifact can further be classified as visual content that
serves to enhance the user experience, that lies under the actual
content, and that is not required except to retain visual fidelity.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | Examples of this include a coloured background, pattern,  |
| 2    | blend, or image that resides under main body text. In the |
|      | case of white text on a black background, the black       |
|      | background is absolutely necessary to be able to read the |
|      | white text; however, the background itself is merely      |
|      | there to enhance the visual experience. However, a draft  |
|      | or other identifying watermark is classified as a         |
|      | pagination artifact because it does not serve to enhance  |
|      | the experience; rather, it serves as a running artifact   |
|      | typically used on every page in the document. As a        |
|      | further example, a Figure differs from a background       |
|      | artifact in that removal of the graphics objects from a   |
|      | Figure would detract from the overall contextual          |
|      | understanding of the Figure as an entity.                 |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - Tagged conforming readers may have their own ideas      |
|      |   about what page content to consider relevant. A         |
|      |   text-to-speech engine, for instance, probably should    |
|      |   not speak running heads or page numbers when the page   |
|      |   is turned. In general, conforming readers can do any of |
|      |   the following:                                          |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - Disregard elements of page content (for example,        |
|      |   specific types of artifacts) that are not of interest   |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - Treat some page elements as *terminals* that are not to |
|      |   be examined further (for example, to treat an           |
|      |   illustration as a unit for reflow purposes)             |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - Replace an element with alternate text (see 14.9.3,     |
|      |   "Alternate Descriptions")                               |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | Depending on their goals, different conforming readers    |
| 3    | can make different decisions in this regard. The purpose  |
|      | of Tagged PDF is not to prescribe what the conforming     |
|      | reader should do, but to provide sufficient declarative   |
|      | and descriptive information to allow it to make           |
|      | appropriate choices about how to process the content.     |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

To support conforming readers in providing accessibility to users with
disabilities, Tagged PDF documents should use the natural language
specification (**Lang**), alternate description (**Alt**), replacement
text

(**ActualText**), and abbreviation expansion text (**E**) facilities
described in 14.9, "Accessibility Support."

**14.8.2.2.3 Incidental Artifacts**

In addition to objects that are explicitly marked as artifacts and
excluded from the document's logical structure, the running text of a
page may contain other elements and relationships that are not logically
part of the document's real content, but merely incidental results of
the process of laying out that content into a document. They may include
the following elements:

- *Hyphenation*. Among the artifacts introduced by text layout is the
  hyphen marking the incidental division of a word at the end of a line.
  In Tagged PDF, such an incidental word division shall be represented
  by a *soft hyphen* character, which the Unicode mapping algorithm (see
  "Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF" in 14.8.2.4, "Extraction of Character
  Properties") translates to the Unicode value U+00AD. (This character
  is distinct from an ordinary *hard hyphen*, whose Unicode value is
  U+002D.) The producer of a Tagged PDF document shall distinguish
  explicitly between soft and hard hyphens so that the consumer does not
  have to guess which type a given character represents.

NOTE 1 In some languages, the situation is more complicated: there may
be multiple hyphen characters, and hyphenation may change the spelling
of words. See the Example in 14.9.4, "Replacement Text."

- *Text discontinuities*. The running text of a page, as expressed in
  page content order (see 14.8.2.3, "Page Content Order"), may contain
  places where the normal progression of text suffers a discontinuity.
  Conforming readers may recognize such discontinuities by examining the
  document's logical structure.

NOTE 2 For example, the page may contain the beginnings of two separate
articles (see 12.4.3, "Articles"), each of which is continued onto a
later page of the document. The last words of the first article
appearing on the page should not be run together with the first words of
the second article.

- *Hidden page elements*. For a variety of reasons, elements of a
  document's logical content may be invisible on the page: they may be
  clipped, their colour may match the background, or they may be
  obscured by other, overlapping objects. For the purposes of Tagged
  PDF, page content shall be considered to include all text and
  illustrations in their entirety, regardless of whether they are
  visible when the document is displayed or printed.

NOTE 3 For example, formerly invisible elements may become visible when
a page is reflowed, or a text-to-speech engine may choose to speak text
that is not visible to a sighted reader.

**14.8.2.3 Page Content Order**

**14.8.2.3.1 General**

When dealing with material on a page-by-page basis, some Tagged PDF
conforming readers may choose to process elements in *page content
order*, determined by the sequencing of graphics objects within a page's
content stream and of characters within a text object, rather than in
the *logical structure order* defined by a depth-first traversal of the
page's logical structure hierarchy. The two orderings are logically
distinct and may or may not coincide. In particular, any artifacts the
page may contain shall be included in the page content order but not in
the logical structure order, since they are not considered part of the
document's logical structure. The conforming writer is responsible for
establishing both an appropriate page content order for each page and an
appropriate logical structure hierarchy for the entire document.

Because the primary requirement for page content order is to enable
reflow to maintain elements in proper reading sequence, it should
normally (for Western writing systems) proceed from top to bottom (and,
in a multiple-column layout, from column to column), with artifacts in
their correct relative places. In general, all parts of an article that
appear on a given page should be kept together, even if the article
flows to scattered locations on the page. Illustrations or footnotes may
be interspersed with the text of the associated article or may appear at
the end of its content (or, in the case of footnotes, at the end of the
entire page's logical content).

In some situations, conforming writer may be unable to determine correct
page content order for part of a document's contents. In such cases,
*tag suspects (PDF 1.6)* can be used. The conforming writer shall
identify suspect content by using marked content (see 14.6, "Marked
Content") with a tag of TagSuspect, as shown in next Example. The marked
content shall have a properties dictionary with an entry whose name is
**TagSuspect** and whose value is **Ordering**, which indicates that the
ordering of the enclosed marked content does not meet Tagged PDF
specifications.

NOTE This can occur, for example, if content was extracted from another
application, or if there are ambiguities or missing information in text
output.

EXAMPLE /TagSuspect \<\</TagSuspect /Ordering\>\>

> BDC
>
> \.... % Problem page contents EMC

Documents containing tag suspects shall contain a **Suspects** entry
with a value of **true** in the mark information dictionary (see Table
321).

**14.8.2.3.2 Sequencing of Annotations**

Annotations associated with a page are not interleaved within the page's
content stream but shall be placed in the **Annots** array in its page
object (see 7.7.3.3, "Page Objects"). Consequently, the correct position
of an annotation in the page content order is not readily apparent but
shall be determined from the document's logical structure.

Both page content (marked-content sequences) and annotations may be
treated as content items that are referenced from structure elements
(see 14.7.4, "Structure Content"). Structure elements of type Annot
(*PDF 1.5*), Link, or Form (see 14.8.4.4, "Inline-Level Structure
Elements," and 14.8.4.5, "Illustration Elements") explicitly specify the
association between a marked-content sequence and a corresponding
annotation. In other cases, if the structure element corresponding to an
annotation immediately precedes or follows (in the logical structure
order) a structure element corresponding to a marked-content sequence,
the annotation is considered to precede or follow the marked-content
sequence, respectively, in the page content order.

NOTE If necessary, a conforming writer may introduce an empty
marked-content sequence solely to serve as a structure element for the
purpose of positioning adjacent annotations in the page content order.

**14.8.2.3.3 Reverse-Order Show Strings**

NOTE 1 In writing systems that are read from right to left (such as
Arabic or Hebrew), one might expect that the glyphs in a font would have
their origins at the lower right and their widths (rightward horizontal
displacements) specified as negative. For various technical and
historical reasons, however, many such fonts follow the same conventions
as those designed for Western writing systems, with glyph origins at the
lower left and positive widths, as shown in Figure 39. Consequently,
showing text in such right-to-left writing systems requires either
positioning each glyph individually (which is tedious and costly) or
representing text with show strings (see 9.2, "Organization and Use of
Fonts") whose character codes are given in reverse order. When the
latter method is used, the character codes' correct page content order
is the reverse of their order within the show string.

The marked-content tag ReversedChars informs the conforming reader that
show strings within a markedcontent sequence contain characters in the
reverse of page content order. If the sequence encompasses multiple show
strings, only the individual characters within each string shall be
reversed; the strings themselves shall be in natural reading order.

EXAMPLE The sequence

> /ReversedChars BMC
>
> ( olleH ) Tj
>
> −200 0 Td
>
> ( . dlrow ) Tj
>
> EMC
>
> represents the text
>
> Hello world .

The show strings may have a SPACE (U+0020) character at the beginning or
end to indicate a word break (see 14.8.2.5, "Identifying Word Breaks")
but shall not contain interior SPACEs.

NOTE 2 This limitation is not serious, since a SPACE provides an
opportunity to realign the typography without visible effect, and it
serves the valuable purpose of limiting the scope of reversals for
word-processing conforming readers.

**14.8.2.4 Extraction of Character Properties**

**14.8.2.4.1 General**

Tagged PDF enables character codes to be unambiguously converted to
Unicode values representing the information content of the text. There
are several methods for doing this; a Tagged PDF document shall conform
to at least one of them (see "Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF" in
14.8.2.4, "Extraction of Character Properties"). In addition, Tagged PDF
enables some characteristics of the associated fonts to be deduced (see
"Font Characteristics" in 14.8.2.4, "Extraction of Character
Properties").

NOTE These Unicode values and font characteristics can then be used for
such operations as cut-and-paste editing, searching, text-to-speech
conversion, and exporting to other applications or file formats.

**14.8.2.4.2 Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF**

Tagged PDF requires that every character code in a document can be
mapped to a corresponding Unicode value.

NOTE 1 Unicode defines scalar values for most of the characters used in
the world's languages and writing systems, as well as providing a
private use area for application-specific characters. Information about
Unicode can be found in the Unicode Standard, by the Unicode Consortium
(see the Bibliography).

The methods for mapping a character code to a Unicode value are
described in 9.10.2, "Mapping Character Codes to Unicode Values." A
conforming writer shall ensure that the PDF file contains enough
information to map all character codes to Unicode by one of the methods
described there.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 2 An **Alt**, **ActualText**, or **E** entry specified in a
         structure element dictionary or a marked-content property
         list (see 14.9.3, "Alternate Descriptions," 14.9.4,
         "Replacement Text," and 14.9.5, "Expansion of Abbreviations
         and Acronyms") may affect the character stream that some
         conforming readers actually use. For example, some
         conforming readers may choose to use the **Alt** or
         **ActualText** value and ignore all text and other content
         associated with the structure element and its descendants.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE 3 Some uses of Tagged PDF require characters that may not be
         available in all fonts, such as the soft hyphen (see
         14.8.2.2.3, "Incidental Artifacts"). Such characters may be
         represented either by adding them to the font's encoding or
         CMap and using **ToUnicode** to map them to appropriate
         Unicode values, or by using an **ActualText** entry in the
         associated structure element to provide substitute
         characters.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

**14.8.2.4.3 Font Characteristics**

In addition to a Unicode value, each character code in a content stream
has an associated set of font characteristics. These characteristics are
not specified explicitly in the PDF file. Instead, the conforming reader
derives the characteristics from the font descriptor for the font that
is set in the text state at the time the character is shown.

NOTE These characteristics are useful when exporting text to another
application or file format that has a limited repertoire of available
fonts.

Table 331 lists a common set of font characteristics corresponding to
those used in CSS and XSL; the W3C document *Extensible Stylesheet
Language (XSL) 1.0* provides more information (see the Bibliography).
Each of the characteristics shall be derived from information available
in the font descriptor's **Flags** entry (see 9.8.2, "Font Descriptor
Flags").

> **Table 331 -- Derivation of font characteristics**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Characteristic**   **Type**   **Derivation**
  -------------------- ---------- ---------------------------------------
  Serifed              boolean    The value of the Serif flag in the font
                                  descriptor's **Flags** entry

  Proportional         boolean    The complement of the FixedPitch flag
                                  in the font descriptor's **Flags**
                                  entry

  Italic               boolean    The value of the Italic flag in the
                                  font descriptor's **Flags** entry

  Smallcap             boolean    The value of the SmallCap flag in the
                                  font descriptor's **Flags** entry
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The characteristics shown in the table apply only to character codes
contained in show strings within content streams. They do not exist for
alternate description text (**Alt**), replacement text (**ActualText**),
or abbreviation expansion text (**E**).

For the standard 14 Type 1 fonts, the font descriptor may be missing;
the well-known values for those fonts shall be used.

Tagged PDF in PDF 1.5 defines a wider set of font characteristics, which
provide information needed when converting PDF to other files formats
such as RTF, HTML, XML, and OEB, and also improve accessibility and
reflow of tables. Table 332 lists these *font selector attributes* and
shows how their values shall be derived.

If the *FontFamily*, *FontWeight* and *FontStretch* fields are not
present in the font descriptor, these values shall be derived from the
font name in a manner of the conforming reader's choosing.

**14.8.2.5 Identifying Word Breaks**

NOTE 1 A document's text stream defines not only the characters in a
page's text but also the words. Unlike a character, the notion of a word
is not precisely defined but depends on the purpose for which the text
is being processed. A reflow tool needs to determine where it can break
the running text into lines; a text-to-speech engine needs to identify
the words to be vocalized; spelling checkers and other applications all
have their own ideas of what constitutes a word. It is not important for
a Tagged PDF document to identify the words within the text stream
according to a single, unambiguous definition that satisfies all of
these clients. What is important is that there be enough information
available for each client to make that determination for itself.

A conforming reader of a Tagged PDF document may find words by
sequentially examining the Unicode character stream, perhaps augmented
by replacement text specified with **ActualText** (see 14.9.4,
"Replacement Text"). For this purpose the spacing characters that would
be present to separate words in a pure text representation shall be
present in the Tagged PDF representation of the text.

| NOTE | > The conforming reader does not need to guess about word  |
| 2    | > breaks based on information such as glyph positioning on |
|      | > the page, font changes, or glyph sizes.                  |

**14.8.3 Basic Layout Model**

The basic layout model begins with the notion of a *reference area*.
This is a rectangular region used as a frame or guide in which to place
the document's content. Some of the standard structure attributes, such
as **StartIndent** and **EndIndent** (see 14.8.5.4.3, "Layout Attributes
for BLSEs"), shall be measured from the boundaries of the reference
area. Reference areas are not specified explicitly but are inferred from
context. Those of interest are generally the column area or areas in a
general text layout, the outer bounding box of a table and those of its
component cells, and the bounding box of an illustration or other
floating element.

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > Tagged PDF's standard structure types and attributes    |
| 1    | > shall be interpreted in the context of a basic layout   |
|      | > model that describes the arrangement of structure       |
|      | > elements on the page. This model is designed to capture |
|      | > the general intent of the document's underlying         |
|      | > structure and does not necessarily correspond to the    |
|      | > one actually used for page layout by the application    |
|      | > creating the document. (The PDF content stream          |
|      | > specifies the exact appearance.) The goal is to provide |
|      | > sufficient information for conforming readers to make   |
|      | > their own layout decisions while preserving the         |

|      | > layout models allow.                                    |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | The Tagged PDF layout model resembles the ones used in    |
| 2    | markup languages such as HTML, CSS, XSL, and              |
|      |                                                           |

|      | > expected.                                               |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

The standard structure types are divided into four main categories
according to the roles they play in page layout:

- *Grouping elements* (see 14.8.4.2, "Grouping Elements") group other
  elements into sequences or hierarchies but hold no content directly
  and have no direct effect on layout.

- *Block-level structure elements* (*BLSE*s) (see 14.8.4.3, "Block-Level
  Structure Elements") describe the overall layout of content on the
  page, proceeding in the *block-progression direction*.

- *Inline-level structure elements* (*ILSE*s) (see 14.8.4.4,
  "Inline-Level Structure Elements") describe the layout of content
  within a BLSE, proceeding in the *inline-progression direction*.

- *Illustration elements* (see 14.8.4.5, "Illustration Elements") are
  compact sequences of content, in page content order, that are
  considered to be unitary objects with respect to page layout. An
  illustration can be treated as either a BLSE or an ILSE.

The meaning of the terms *block-progression direction* and
*inline-progression direction* depends on the writing system in use, as
specified by the standard attribute **WritingMode** (see 14.8.5.4.2,
"General Layout Attributes"). In Western writing systems, the block
direction is from top to bottom and the inline direction is from left to
right. Other writing systems use different directions for laying out
content.

Because the progression directions can vary depending on the writing
system, edges of areas and directions on the page are identified by
terms that are neutral with respect to the progression order rather than
by familiar terms such as *up*, *down*, *left*, and *right*. Block
layout proceeds from *before* to *after*, inline from *start* to *end*.
Thus, for example, in Western writing systems, the before and after
edges of a reference area are at the top and bottom, respectively, and
the start and end edges are at the left and right. Another term, *shift
direction* (the direction of shift for a superscript), refers to the
direction opposite that for block progression---that is, from after to
before (in Western writing systems, from bottom to top).

BLSEs shall be *stacked* within a reference area in block-progression
order. In general, the first BLSE shall be placed against the before
edge of the reference area. Subsequent BLSEs shall be stacked against
preceding ones, progressing toward the after edge, until no more BLSEs
fit in the reference area. If the overflowing BLSE allows itself to be
split---such as a paragraph that can be split between lines of text---a
portion of it may be included in the current reference area and the
remainder carried over to a subsequent reference area (either elsewhere
on the same page or on another page of the document). Once the amount of
content that fits in a reference area is determined, the placements of
the individual BLSEs may be adjusted to bias the placement toward the
before edge, the middle, or the after edge of the reference area, or the
spacing within or between BLSEs may be adjusted to fill the full extent
of the reference area.

BLSEs may be nested, with child BLSEs stacked within a parent BLSE in
the same manner as BLSEs within a reference area. Except in a few
instances noted (the BlockAlign and InlineAlign elements), such nesting
of BLSEs does not result in the nesting of reference areas; a single
reference area prevails for all levels of nested BLSEs.

Within a BLSE, child ILSEs shall be *packed* into *lines*. *Direct
content items*---those that are immediate children of a BLSE rather than
contained within a child ILSE---shall be implicitly treated as ILSEs for
packing purposes. Each line shall be treated as a synthesized BLSE and
shall be stacked within the parent BLSE. Lines may be intermingled with
other BLSEs within the parent area. This line-building process is
analogous to the stacking of BLSEs within a reference area, except that
it proceeds in the inline-progression rather than the blockprogression
direction: a line shall be packed with ILSEs beginning at the start edge
of the containing BLSE and continuing until the end edge shall be
reached and the line is full. The overflowing ILSE may allow itself to
be broken at linguistically determined or explicitly marked break points
(such as hyphenation points within a word), and the remaining fragment
shall be carried over to the next line.

Certain values of an element's **Placement** attribute remove the
element from the normal stacking or packing process and allow it instead
to float to a specified edge of the enclosing reference area or parent
BLSE; see "General Layout Attributes" in 14.8.5.4, "Layout Attributes,"
for further discussion.

Two enclosing rectangles shall be associated with each BLSE and ILSE
(including direct content items that are treated implicitly as ILSEs):

- The *content rectangle* shall be derived from the shape of the
  enclosed content and defines the bounds used for the layout of any
  included child elements.

- The *allocation rectangle* includes any additional borders or spacing
  surrounding the element, affecting how it shall be positioned with
  respect to adjacent elements and the enclosing content rectangle or
  reference area.

The definitions of these rectangles shall be determined by layout
attributes associated with the structure element; see 14.8.5.4.5,
"Content and Allocation Rectangles" for further discussion.

**14.8.4 Standard Structure Types**

**14.8.4.1 General**

Tagged PDF's *standard structure types* characterize the role of a
content element within the document and, in conjunction with the
standard structure attributes (described in 14.8.5, "Standard Structure
Attributes"), how that content is laid out on the page. As discussed in
14.7.3, "Structure Types," the structure type of a logical structure
element shall be specified by the **S** entry in its structure element
dictionary. To be considered a standard structure type, this value shall
be either:

- One of the standard structure type names described in 14.8.4.2,
  "Grouping Elements."

- An arbitrary name that shall be mapped to one of the standard names by
  the document's role map (see 14.7.3, "Structure Types"), possibly
  through multiple levels of mapping.

NOTE 1 Beginning with PDF 1.5, an element name is always mapped to its
corresponding name in the role map, if there is one, even if the
original name is one of the standard types. This is done to allow the
element, for example, to represent a tag with the same name as a
standard role, even though its use differs from the standard role.

Ordinarily, structure elements having standard structure types shall be
processed the same way whether the type is expressed directly or is
determined indirectly from the role map. However, some conforming
readers may ascribe additional semantics to nonstandard structure types,
even though the role map associates them with standard ones.

NOTE 2 For instance, the actual values of the **S** entries may be used
when exporting to a tagged representation such as XML, and the
corresponding role-mapped values shall be used when converting to
presentation formats such as HTML or RTF, or for purposes such as reflow
or accessibility to users with disabilities.

NOTE 3 Most of the standard element types are designed primarily for
laying out text; the terminology reflects this usage. However, a layout
may in fact include any type of content, such as path or image objects.

The content items associated with a structure element shall be laid out
on the page as if they were blocks of text (for a BLSE) or characters
within a line of text (for an ILSE).

**14.8.4.2 Grouping Elements**

*Grouping elements* shall be used solely to group other structure
elements; they are not directly associated with content items. Table 333
describes the standard structure types for elements in this category.
H.8, "Structured Elements That Describe Hierarchical Lists" provides an
example of nested table of content items.

In a tagged PDF document, the structure tree shall contain a single
top-level element; that is, the structure tree root (identified by the
**StructTreeRoot** entry in the document catalogue) shall have only one
child in its **K** (kids) array. If the PDF file contains a complete
document, the structure type Document should be used for this toplevel
element in the logical structure hierarchy. If the file contains a
well-formed document fragment, one of the structure types Part, Art,
Sect, or Div may be used instead.

  Part          (Part) A large-scale division of a document.
                This type of element is appropriate for
                grouping articles or sections.

  Art           (Article) A relatively self-contained body of
                text constituting a single narrative or
                exposition. Articles should be disjoint; that
                is, they should not contain other articles as
                constituent elements.

**14.8.4.3 Block-Level Structure Elements**

**14.8.4.3.1 General**

A *block-level structure element (BLSE)* is any region of text or other
content that is laid out in the blockprogression direction, such as a
paragraph, heading, list item, or footnote. A structure element is a
BLSE if its structure type (after role mapping, if any) is one of those
listed in Table 334. All other standard structure types shall be treated
as ILSEs, with the following exceptions:

- TR (Table row), TH (Table header), TD (Table data), THead (Table
  head), TBody (Table body), and TFoot (Table footer), which shall be
  used to group elements within a table and shall be considered neither
  BLSEs nor ILSEs

- Elements with a **Placement** attribute (see "General Layout
  Attributes" in 14.8.5.4, "Layout Attributes") other than the default
  value of Inline

+------------------+---------------+----------+

In many cases, a BLSE may appear as one compact, contiguous piece of
page content; in other cases, it may be discontiguous.

NOTE Examples of the latter include a BLSE that extends across a page
boundary or is interrupted in the page content order by another, nested
BLSE or a directly included footnote. When necessary, Tagged conforming
readers can recognize such fragmented BLSEs from the logical structure
and use this information to reassemble them and properly lay them out.

**14.8.4.3.2 Paragraphlike Elements**

Table 335 describes structure types for *paragraphlike elements* that
consist of running text and other content laid out in the form of
conventional paragraphs (as opposed to more specialized layouts such as
lists and tables).

> **Table 335 -- Standard structure types for paragraphlike elements**

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  **Structure   **Description**
  Type**        
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------
  H             (Heading) A label for a subdivision of a
                document's content. It should be the first
                child of the division that it heads.

  H1--H6        Headings with specific levels, for use in
                conforming writers that cannot hierarchically
                nest their sections and thus cannot determine
                the level of a heading from its level of
                nesting.

  P             (Paragraph) A low-level division of text.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

**14.8.4.3.3 List Elements**

Table 336 describes structure types for organizing the content of lists.
H.8, "Structured Elements That Describe Hierarchical Lists" provides an
example of nested list entries.

> **Table 336 -- Standard structure types for list elements**

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  **Structure   **Description**
  Type**        
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------
  L             (List) A sequence of items of like meaning and
                importance. Its immediate children should be
                an optional caption (structure type Caption;
                see 14.8.4.2, "Grouping Elements") followed by
                one or more list items (structure type LI).

  LI            (List item) An individual member of a list.
                Its children may be one or more labels, list
                bodies, or both (structure types Lbl or
                LBody).

| Lbl         | (Label) A name or number that distinguishes |
|             | a given item from others in the same list   |
|             | or other group of like items.               |
|             |                                             |
|             | NOTE In a dictionary list, for example, it  |
|             | contains the term being defined; in a       |
|             | bulleted or numbered list, it contains the  |
|             | bullet character or the number of the list  |
|             | item and associated punctuation.            |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| LBody       | (List body) The descriptive content of a    |
|             | list item. In a dictionary list, for        |
|             | example, it contains the definition of the  |
|             | term. It may either contain the content     |
|             | directly or have other BLSEs, perhaps       |
|             | including nested lists, as children.        |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------+

**14.8.4.3.4 Table Elements**

The structure types described in Table 337 shall be used for organizing
the content of tables.

NOTE 1 Strictly speaking, the *Table* element is a BLSE; the others in
this table are neither BLSEs or ILSEs.

> **Table 337 -- Standard structure types for table elements**

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  **Structure   **Description**
  Type**        
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------
  Table         (Table) A two-dimensional layout of
                rectangular data cells, possibly having a
                complex substructure. It contains either one
                or more table rows (structure type TR) as
                children; or an optional table head (structure
                type THead) followed by one or more table body
                elements (structure type TBody) and an
                optional table footer (structure type TFoot).
                In addition, a table may have a caption
                (structure type Caption; see 14.8.4.2,
                "Grouping Elements") as its first or last
                child.

  TR            (Table row) A row of headings or data in a
                table. It may contain table header cells and
                table data cells (structure types TH and TD).

  TH            (Table header cell) A table cell containing
                header text describing one or more rows or
                columns of the table.

  TD            (Table data cell) A table cell containing data
                that is part of the table's content.

  THead         (Table header row group; *PDF 1.5*) A group of
                rows that constitute the header of a table. If
                the table is split across multiple pages,
                these rows may be redrawn at the top of each
                table fragment (although there is only one
                THead element).

  TBody         (Table body row group; *PDF 1.5*) A group of
                rows that constitute the main body portion of
                a table. If the table is split across multiple
                pages, the body area may be broken apart on a
                row boundary. A table may have multiple TBody
                elements to allow for the drawing of a border
                or background for a set of rows.

  TFoot         (Table footer row group; *PDF 1.5*) A group of
                rows that constitute the footer of a table. If
                the table is split across multiple pages,
                these rows may be redrawn at the bottom of
                each table fragment (although there is only
                one TFoot element.)
  ------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 The association of headers with rows and columns of data is
typically determined heuristically by applications. Such heuristics may
fail for complex tables; the standard attributes for tables shown in
Table 348 can be used to make the association explicit.

**14.8.4.3.5 Usage Guidelines for Block-Level Structure**

Because different conforming readers use PDF's logical structure
facilities in different ways, Tagged PDF does not enforce any strict
rules regarding the order and nesting of elements using the standard
structure types. Furthermore, each export format has its own conventions
for logical structure. However, adhering to certain general guidelines
helps to achieve the most consistent and predictable interpretation
among different Tagged PDF consumers.

As described under 14.8.4.2, "Grouping Elements," a Tagged PDF document
may have one or more levels of grouping elements, such as Document,
Part, Art (Article), Sect (Section), and Div (Division). The descendants
of these should be BLSEs, such as H (Heading), P (Paragraph), and L
(List), that hold the actual content. Their descendants, in turn, should
be either content items or ILSEs that further describe the content.

NOTE 1 As noted earlier, elements with structure types that would
ordinarily be treated as ILSEs may have a ***Placement*** attribute (see
"General Layout Attributes" in 14.8.5.4, "Layout Attributes") that
causes them to be treated as BLSEs instead. Such elements may be
included as BLSEs in the same manner as headings and paragraphs.

The block-level structure may follow one of two principal paradigms:

- *Strongly structured*. The grouping elements nest to as many levels as
  necessary to reflect the organization of the material into articles,
  sections, subsections, and so on. At each level, the children of the
  grouping element should consist of a heading (H), one or more
  paragraphs (P) for content at that level, and perhaps one or more
  additional grouping elements for nested subsections.

- *Weakly structured*. The document is relatively flat, having perhaps
  only one or two levels of grouping elements, with all the headings,
  paragraphs, and other BLSEs as their immediate children. In this case,
  the organization of the material is not reflected in the logical
  structure; however, it may be expressed by the use of headings with
  specific levels (H1--H6).

NOTE 2 The strongly structured paradigm is used by some rich document
models based on XML. The weakly structured paradigm is typical of
documents represented in HTML.

Lists and tables should be organized using the specific structure types
described under "List Elements" in 14.8.4.3, "Block-Level Structure
Elements," and "Table Elements" in 14.8.4.3, "Block-Level Structure
Elements". Likewise, tables of contents and indexes should be structured
as described for the TOC and Index structure types under "Grouping
Elements" in 14.8.4.2, "Grouping Elements."

**14.8.4.4 Inline-Level Structure Elements**

**14.8.4.4.1 General**

An *inline-level structure element (ILSE)* contains a portion of text or
other content having specific styling characteristics or playing a
specific role in the document. Within a paragraph or other block defined
by a containing BLSE, consecutive ILSEs---possibly intermixed with other
content items that are direct children of the parent BLSE---are laid out
consecutively in the inline-progression direction (left to right in
Western writing systems). The resulting content may be broken into
multiple *lines*, which in turn shall be stacked in the blockprogression
direction. An ILSE may in turn contain a BLSE, which shall be treated as
a unitary item of layout in the inline direction. Table 338 lists the
standard structure types for ILSEs.

**14.8.4.4.2 Link Elements**

NOTE 1 Link annotations (like all PDF annotations) are associated with a
geometric region of the page rather than with a particular object in its
content stream. Any connection between the link and the content is based
solely on visual appearance rather than on an explicitly specified
association. For this reason, link annotations alone are not useful to
users with visual impairments or to applications needing to determine
which content can be activated to invoke a hypertext link.

Tagged PDF link elements (structure type Link) use PDF's logical
structure facilities to establish the association between content items
and link annotations, providing functionality comparable to HTML
hypertext links. The following items may be children of a link element:

- One or more content items or other ILSEs (except other links)

- Object references (see 14.7.4.3, "PDF Objects as Content Items") to
  one or more link annotations associated with the content

When a **Link** structure element describes a span of text to be
associated with a link annotation and that span wraps from the end of
one line to the beginning of another, the **Link** structure element
shall include a single object reference that associates the span with
the associated link annotation. Further, the link annotation shall use
the **QuadPoint** entry to denote the active areas on the page.

EXAMPLE 1 The **Link** structure element references a link annotation
that includes a **QuadPoint** entry that boxes the

> strings "with a" and "link". That is, the **QuadPoint** entry contains
> 16 numbers: the first 8 numbers describe a quadrilateral for "with a",
> and the next 8 describe a quadrilateral for "link."

Here is some text with a

> ![](media/image203.png)
>
> link inside.
>
> ![](media/image204.png)

NOTE 2 Beginning with PDF 1.7, use of the **Link** structure element to
enclose multiple link annotations is deprecated.

EXAMPLE 2 Consider the following fragment of HTML code, which produces a
line of text containing a hypertext link:

> \< html \>
>
> \< body \>
>
> \< p \>
>
> Here is some text \< a href = http : / / www . adobe . com \>with a
> link\< /a \> inside .
>
> \< /body \>
>
> \< /html \>
>
> This code sample shows an equivalent fragment of PDF using a link
> element, whose text it displays in blue and underlined.

**14.8.4.4.3 Annotation Elements**

Tagged PDF annotation elements (structure type Annot; *PDF 1.5*) use
PDF's logical structure facilities to establish the association between
content items and PDF annotations. Annotation elements shall be used for
all types of annotations other than links (see "Link Elements" in
14.8.4.3, "Block-Level Structure Elements") and forms (see Table 340).

The following items may be children of an annotation element:

- Object references (see 14.7.4.3, "PDF Objects as Content Items") to
  one or more annotation dictionaries

- Optionally, one or more content items (such as marked-content
  sequences) or other ILSEs (except other annotations) associated with
  the annotations

If an Annot element has no children other than object references, its
rendering shall be defined by the appearance of the referenced
annotations, and its text content shall be treated as if it were a Span
element. It may have an optional **BBox** attribute; if supplied, this
attribute overrides the rectangle specified by the annotation
dictionary's **Rect** entry.

If the Annot element has children that are content items, those children
represent the displayed form of the annotation, and the appearance of
the associated annotation may also be applied (for example, with a
**Highlight** annotation).

There may be multiple children that are object references to different
annotations, subject to the constraint that the annotations shall be the
same except for their **Rect** entry. This is much the same as is done
for the Link element; it allows an annotation to be associated with
discontiguous pieces of content, such as line-wrapped text.

**14.8.4.4.4 Ruby and Warichu Elements**

Ruby text is a side note, written in a smaller text size and placed
adjacent to the base text to which it refers. It is used in Japanese and
Chinese to describe the pronunciation of unusual words or to describe
such items as abbreviations and logos.

Warichu text is a comment or annotation, written in a smaller text size
and formatted onto two smaller lines within the height of the containing
text line and placed following (inline) the base text to which it
refers. It is used in Japanese for descriptive comments and for ruby
annotation text that is too long to be aesthetically formatted as a
ruby.

> **Table 339 -- Standard structure types for Ruby and Warichu elements
> (*PDF 1.5*)**

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  **Structure   **Description**
  Type**        
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------
  Ruby          (Ruby) The wrapper around the entire ruby
                assembly. It shall contain one RB element
                followed by either an RT element or a
                three-element group consisting of RP, RT, and
                RP. Ruby elements and their content elements
                shall not break across multiple lines.

  RB            (Ruby base text) The full-size text to which
                the ruby annotation is applied. RB may contain
                text, other inline elements, or a mixture of
                both. It may have the **RubyAlign** attribute.

  RT            (Ruby annotation text) The smaller-size text
                that shall be placed adjacent to the ruby base
                text. It may contain text, other inline
                elements, or a mixture of both. It may have
                the **RubyAlign** and **RubyPosition**
                attributes.

**14.8.4.5 Illustration Elements**

Tagged PDF defines an *illustration element* as any structure element
whose structure type (after role mapping, if any) is one of those listed
in Table 340. The illustration's content shall consist of one or more
complete graphics objects. It shall not appear between the **BT** and
**ET** operators delimiting a text object (see 9.4, "Text Objects"). It
may include clipping only in the form of a contained marked clipping
sequence, as defined in 14.6.3, "Marked Content and Clipping." In Tagged
PDF, all such marked clipping sequences shall carry the marked-content
tag Clip.

> **Table 340 -- Standard structure types for illustration elements**

+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **Structure | **Description**                             |
| Type**      |                                             |
+:============+=============================================+
| Figure      | (Figure) An item of graphical content. Its  |
|             | placement may be specified with the         |
|             | **Placement** layout attribute (see         |
|             | "General Layout Attributes" in 14.8.5.4,    |
|             | "Layout Attributes").                       |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Formula     | (Formula) A mathematical formula.           |
|             |                                             |
|             | This structure type is useful only for      |
|             | identifying an entire content element as a  |
|             | formula. No standard structure types are    |
|             | defined for identifying individual          |
|             | components within the formula. From a       |
|             | formatting standpoint, the formula shall be |
|             | treated similarly to a figure (structure    |
|             | type Figure).                               |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Form        | (Form) A widget annotation representing an  |
|             | interactive form field (see 12.7,           |
|             | "Interactive Forms"). If the element        |
|             | contains a **Role** attribute, it may       |
|             | contain content items that represent the    |
|             | value of the (non-interactive) form field.  |
|             | If the element omits a **Role** attribute   |
|             | (see Table 348), it shall have only one     |
|             | child: an object reference (see 14.7.4.3,   |
|             | "PDF Objects as Content Items") identifying |
|             | the widget annotation. The annotations'     |
|             | appearance stream (see 12.5.5, "Appearance  |
|             | Streams") shall describe the appearance of  |
|             | the form element.                           |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------+

An illustration may have logical substructure, including other
illustrations. For purposes of reflow, however, it shall be moved (and
perhaps resized) as a unit, without examining its internal contents. To
be useful for reflow, it shall have a **BBox** attribute. It may also
have **Placement**, **Width**, **Height**, and **BaselineShift**
attributes (see 14.8.5.4, "Layout Attributes").

Often an illustration is logically part of, or at least attached to, a
paragraph or other element of a document. Any such containment or
attachment shall be represented through the use of the Figure structure
type. The Figure element indicates the point of attachment, and its
**Placement** attribute describes the nature of the attachment. An
illustration element without a **Placement** attribute shall be treated
as an ILSE and laid out inline.

For accessibility to users with disabilities and other text extraction
purposes, an illustration element should have an **Alt** entry or an
**ActualText** entry (or both) in its structure element dictionary (see
14.9.3, "Alternate Descriptions," and 14.9.4, "Replacement Text").
**Alt** is a description of the illustration, whereas **ActualText**
gives the exact text equivalent of a graphical illustration that has the
appearance of text.

**14.8.5 Standard Structure Attributes**

**14.8.5.1 General**

In addition to the standard structure types, Tagged PDF defines standard
layout and styling attributes for structure elements of those types.
These attributes enable predictable formatting to be applied during
operations such as reflow and export of PDF content to other document
formats.

As discussed in 14.7.5, "Structure Attributes," attributes shall be
defined in *attribute objects*, which are dictionaries or streams
attached to a structure element in either of two ways:

- The **A** entry in the structure element dictionary identifies an
  attribute object or an array of such objects.

- The **C** entry in the structure element dictionary gives the name of
  an *attribute class* or an array of such names. The class name is in
  turn looked up in the *class map*, a dictionary identified by the
  **ClassMap** entry in the structure tree root, yielding an attribute
  object or array of objects corresponding to the class.

In addition to the standard structure attributes described in 14.8.5.2,
"Standard Attribute Owners," there are several other optional
entries---**Lang**, **Alt**, **ActualText**, and **E**---that are
described in 14.9, "Accessibility Support," but are useful to other PDF
consumers as well. They appear in the following places in a PDF file
(rather than in attribute dictionaries):

- As entries in the structure element dictionary (see Table 323)

- As entries in property lists attached to marked-content sequences with
  a Span tag (see 14.6, "Marked Content")

The Example in 14.7.6, "Example of Logical Structure," illustrates the
use of standard structure attributes.

**14.8.5.2 Standard Attribute Owners**

Each attribute object has an *owner*, specified by the object's **O**
entry, which determines the interpretation of the attributes defined in
the object's dictionary. Multiple owners may define like-named
attributes with different value types or interpretations. Tagged PDF
defines a set of standard attribute owners, shown in Table 341.

limited by Tagged PDF.

**14.8.5.3 Attribute Values and Inheritance**

Some attributes are defined as *inheritable*. Inheritable attributes
propagate down the structure tree; that is, an attribute that is
specified for an element shall apply to all the descendants of the
element in the structure tree unless a descendent element specifies an
explicit value for the attribute.

NOTE 1 The description of each of the standard attributes in this
sub-clause specifies whether their values are inheritable.

An inheritable attribute may be specified for an element for the purpose
of propagating its value to child elements, even if the attribute is not
meaningful for the parent element. Non-inheritable attributes may be
specified only for elements on which they would be meaningful.

The following list shows the priority for determining attribute values.
A conforming reader determines an attribute's value to be the first item
in the following list that applies:

a)  The value of the attribute specified in the element's **A** entry,
    owned by one of the export formats (such as **XML**, **HTML-3.20**,
    **HTML-4.01**, **OEB-1.0**, **CSS-1.00**, **CSS-2.0**, and **RTF**),
    if present, and if outputting to that format

b)  The value of the attribute specified in the element's **A** entry,
    owned by **Layout**, **PrintField**, **Table** or **List**, if
    present

c)  The value of the attribute specified in a class map associated with
    the element's **C** entry, if there is one

d)  The resolved value of the parent structure element, if the attribute
    is inheritable

e)  The default value for the attribute, if there is one

NOTE 2 The attributes ***Lang***, ***Alt***, ***ActualText***, and
***E*** do not appear in attribute dictionaries. The rules governing
their application are discussed in 14.9, "Accessibility Support."

There is no semantic distinction between attributes that are specified
explicitly and ones that are inherited. Logically, the structure tree
has attributes fully bound to each element, even though some may be
inherited from an ancestor element. This is consistent with the
behaviour of properties (such as font characteristics) that are not
specified by structure attributes but shall be derived from the content.

**14.8.5.4 Layout Attributes**

**14.8.5.4.1 General**

*Layout attributes* specify parameters of the layout process used to
produce the appearance described by a document's PDF content. Attributes
in this category shall be defined in attribute objects whose **O**
(owner) entry has the value **Layout** (or is one of the format-specific
owner names listed in Table 341).

NOTE The intent is that these parameters can be used to reflow the
content or export it to some other document format with at least basic
styling preserved.

Table 342 summarizes the standard layout attributes and the structure
elements to which they apply. The following sub-clauses describe the
meaning and usage of these attributes.

As described in 14.8.5.3, "Attribute Values and Inheritance," an
inheritable attribute may be specified for any element to propagate it
to descendants, regardless of whether it is meaningful for that element.

**14.8.5.4.4 Layout Attributes for ILSEs**

The attributes described in Table 345 apply to inline-level structure
elements (ILSEs). They may also be specified for a block-level element
(BLSE) and may apply to any content items that are its immediate
children.

**14.8.5.4.5 Content and Allocation Rectangles**

As defined in 14.8.3, "Basic Layout Model," an element's *content
rectangle* is an enclosing rectangle derived from the shape of the
element's content, which shall define the bounds used for the layout of
any included child elements. The *allocation rectangle* includes any
additional borders or spacing surrounding the element, affecting how it
shall be positioned with respect to adjacent elements and the enclosing
content rectangle or reference area.

The exact definition of the content rectangle shall depend on the
element's structure type:

- For a table cell (structure type TH or TD), the content rectangle
  shall be determined from the bounding box of all graphics objects in
  the cell's content, taking into account any explicit bounding boxes
  (such as the **BBox** entry in a form XObject). This implied size may
  be explicitly overridden by the cell's **Width** and **Height**
  attributes. The cell's height shall be adjusted to equal the maximum
  height of any cell in its row; its width shall be adjusted to the
  maximum width of any cell in its column.

- For any other BLSE, the height of the content rectangle shall be the
  sum of the heights of all BLSEs it contains, plus any additional
  spacing adjustments between these elements.

- For an ILSE that contains text, the height of the content rectangle
  shall be set by the **LineHeight** attribute. The width shall be
  determined by summing the widths of the contained characters, adjusted
  for any indents, letter spacing, word spacing, or line-end conditions.

- For an ILSE that contains an illustration or table, the content
  rectangle shall be determined from the bounding box of all graphics
  objects in the content, and shall take into account any explicit
  bounding boxes (such as the **BBox** entry in a form XObject). This
  implied size may be explicitly overridden by the element's **Width**
  and **Height** attributes.

- For an ILSE that contains a mixture of elements, the height of the
  content rectangle shall be determined by aligning the child objects
  relative to one another based on their text baseline (for text ILSEs)
  or end edge (for non-text ILSEs), along with any applicable
  **BaselineShift** attribute (for all ILSEs), and finding the extreme
  top and bottom for all elements.

NOTE Some conforming readers may apply this process to all elements
within the block; others may apply it on a line-by-line basis.

The allocation rectangle shall be derived from the content rectangle in
a way that also depends on the structure type:

- For a BLSE, the allocation rectangle shall be equal to the content
  rectangle with its before and after edges adjusted by the element's
  **SpaceBefore** and **SpaceAfter** attributes, if any, but with no
  changes to the start and end edges.

- For an ILSE, the allocation rectangle is the same as the content
  rectangle.

**14.8.5.4.6 Illustration Attributes**

Particular uses of illustration elements (structure types Figure,
Formula, or Form) shall have additional restrictions:

- When an illustration element has a **Placement** attribute of Block,
  it shall have a **Height** attribute with an explicitly specified
  numerical value (not Auto). This value shall be the sole source of
  information about the illustration's extent in the block-progression
  direction.

- When an illustration element has a **Placement** attribute of Inline,
  it shall have a **Width** attribute with an explicitly specified
  numerical value (not Auto). This value shall be the sole source of
  information about the illustration's extent in the inline-progression
  direction.

- When an illustration element has a **Placement** attribute of Inline,
  Start, or End, the value of its **BaselineShift** attribute shall be
  used to determine the position of its after edge relative to the text
  baseline; **BaselineShift** shall be ignored for all other values of
  **Placement**. (An illustration element with a **Placement** value of
  Start may be used to create a dropped capital; one with a
  **Placement** value of Inline may be used to create a raised capital.)

**14.8.5.4.7 Column Attributes**

The attributes described in Table 346 shall be present for the grouping
elements Art, Sect, and Div (see 14.8.4.2, "Grouping Elements"). They
shall be used when the content in the grouping element is divided into
columns.

> **Table 346 -- Standard column attributes**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**            **Type**   **Value**
  ------------------ ---------- -----------------------------------------
  **ColumnCount**    integer    *(Optional; not inheritable; PDF 1.6)*
                                The number of columns in the content of
                                the grouping element. Default value: 1.

  **ColumnGap**      number or  *(Optional; not inheritable; PDF 1.6)*
                     array      The desired space between adjacent
                                columns, measured in default user space
                                units in the inline-progression
                                direction. If the value is a number, it
                                specifies the space between all columns.
                                If the value is an array, it should
                                contain numbers, the first element
                                specifying the space between the first
                                and second columns, the second specifying
                                the space between the second and third
                                columns, and so on. If there are fewer
                                than **ColumnCount** - 1 numbers, the
                                last element shall specify all remaining
                                spaces; if there are more than
                                **ColumnCount** - 1 numbers, the excess
                                array elements shall be ignored.

  **ColumnWidths**   number or  *(Optional; not inheritable; PDF 1.6)*
                     array      The desired width of the columns,
                                measured in default user space units in
                                the inline-progression direction. If the
                                value is a number, it specifies the width
                                of all columns. If the value is an array,
                                it shall contain numbers, representing
                                the width of each column, in order. If
                                there are fewer than **ColumnCount**
                                numbers, the last element shall specify
                                all remaining widths; if there are more
                                than **ColumnCount** numbers, the excess
                                array elements shall be ignored.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**14.8.5.5 List Attribute**

If present, the **ListNumbering** attribute, described in Table 347,
shall appear in an L (List) element. It controls the interpretation of
the Lbl (Label) elements within the list's LI (List item) elements (see
"List Elements" in 14.8.4.3, "Block-Level Structure Elements"). This
attribute may only be defined in attribute objects whose **O** (owner)
entry has the value **List** or is one of the format-specific owner
names listed in Table 341.

NOTE This attribute is used to allow a content extraction tool to
autonumber a list. However, the *Lbl* elements within the table should
nevertheless contain the resulting numbers explicitly, so that the
document can be reflowed or printed without the need for autonumbering.

**14.8.5.6 PrintField Attributes**

*(PDF 1.7)* The attributes described in Table 348 identify the role of
fields in non-interactive PDF forms. Such forms may have originally
contained interactive fields such as text fields and radio buttons but
were then converted into non-interactive PDF files, or they may have
been designed to be printed out and filled in manually. Since the roles
of the fields cannot be determined from interactive elements, the roles
are defined using PrintField attributes.

NOTE PrintField attributes enable screen readers to identify page
content that represents form fields (radio buttons, check boxes, push
buttons, and text fields). These attributes enable the controls in print
form fields to be represented in the logical structure tree and to be
presented to assistive technology as if they were read-only interactive
fields.

### 14.9 Accessibility Support

**14.9.1 General**

PDF includes several facilities in support of accessibility of documents
to users with disabilities. In particular, many visually computer users
with visual impairments use screen readers to read documents aloud. To
enable proper vocalization, either through a screen reader or by some
more direct invocation of a text-to-speech engine, PDF supports the
following features:

- Specifying the natural language used for text in a PDF document---for
  example, as English or Spanish, or used to hide or reveal optional
  content (see 14.9.2, "Natural Language Specification")

- Providing textual descriptions for images or other items that do not
  translate naturally into text (14.9.3, "Alternate Descriptions"), or
  replacement text for content that does translate into text but is
  represented in a nonstandard way (such as with a ligature or
  illuminated character; see 14.9.4, "Replacement Text")

- Specifying the expansion of abbreviations or acronyms (Section 14.9.5,
  "Expansion of Abbreviations and Acronyms")

The core of this support lies in the ability to determine the logical
order of content in a PDF document, independently of the content's
appearance or layout, through logical structure and Tagged PDF, as
described under 14.8.2.3, "Page Content Order." An accessibility
application can extract the content of a document for presentation to
users with disabilities by traversing the structure hierarchy and
presenting the contents of each node. For this reason, conforming
writers ensure that all information in a document is reachable by means
of the structure hierarchy, and they should use the facilities described
in this sub-clause.

NOTE 1 Text can be extracted from Tagged PDF documents and examined or
reused for purposes other than accessibility; see 14.8, "Tagged PDF."

NOTE 2 Additional guidelines for accessibility support of content
published on the Web can be found in the W3C document *Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines* and the documents it points to (see the
Bibliography). **14.9.2 Natural Language Specification**

**14.9.2.1 General**

Natural language may be specified for text in a document or for optional
content.

The natural language used for text in a document shall be determined in
a hierarchical fashion, based on whether an optional **Lang** entry
*(PDF 1.4)* is present in any of several possible locations. At the
highest level, the document's default language (which applies to both
text strings and text within content streams) may be specified by a
**Lang** entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2, "Document
Catalog"). Below this, the language may be specified for the following
items:

- Structure elements of any type (see 14.7.2, "Structure Hierarchy"),
  through a **Lang** entry in the structure element dictionary.

- Marked-content sequences that are not in the structure hierarchy (see
  14.6, "Marked Content"), through a **Lang** entry in a property list
  attached to the marked-content sequence with a Span tag.

+------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > Although **Span** is also a standard structure type, as  |
| 1    | > described under 14.8.4.4, "Inline-Level Structure        |
|      | > Elements," its use here is entirely independent of       |
|      | > logical structure.                                       |
+:=====+============================================================+
| NOTE | > The natural language used for optional content allows    |
| 2    | > content to be hidden or revealed, based on the **Lang**  |
|      | > entry *(PDF 1.5)* in the **Language** dictionary of an   |
|      | > optional content usage dictionary.                       |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > The following sub-clauses provide details on the value   |
| 3    | > of the **Lang** entry and the hierarchical manner in     |
|      | > which the language for text in a document is determined. |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------+

Text strings encoded in Unicode may include an escape sequence or
language tag indicating the language of the text and overriding the
prevailing **Lang** entry (see 7.9.2.2, "Text String Type").

**14.9.2.2 Language Identifiers**

Certain language-related dictionary entries are text strings that
specify *language identifiers*. Such text strings may appear as
***Lang*** entries in the following structures or dictionaries:

- Document catalogue, structure element dictionary, or property list

- Optional content usage dictionary's Language dictionary, the
  hierarchical issues described in 14.9.2.3, "Language Specification
  Hierarchy," shall not apply to this entry

A language identifier shall either be the empty text string, to indicate
that the language is unknown, or a *Language-Tag* as defined in RFC
3066, *Tags for the Identification of Languages*.

Although language codes are commonly represented using lowercase letters
and country codes are commonly represented using uppercase letters, all
tags shall be treated as case insensitive.

**14.9.2.3 Language Specification Hierarchy**

The ***Lang*** entry in the document catalogue shall specify the default
natural language for all text in the document. Language specifications
may appear within structure elements, and they may appear within
marked-content sequences that are not in the structure hierarchy. If
present, such language specifications override the default.

Language specifications within the structure hierarchy apply in this
order:

- A structure element's language specification. If a structure element
  does not have a **Lang** entry, the element shall inherit its language
  from any parent element that has one.

- Within a structure element, a language specification for a nested
  structure element or marked-content sequence

If only part of the page content is contained in the structure
hierarchy, and the structured content is nested within nonstructured
content for which a different language specification applies, the
structure element's language specification shall take precedence.

A language identifier attached to a marked-content sequence with the
Span tag specifies the language for all text in the sequence except for
nested marked content that is contained in the structure hierarchy (in
which case the structure element's language applies) and except where
overridden by language specifications for other nested marked content.

NOTE Examples in this sub-clause illustrate the hierarchical manner in
which the language for text in a document is determined.

EXAMPLE 3 The page's content stream consists of a marked-content
sequence that specifies Spanish as its language by means of the Span tag
with a **Lang** property. Nested within it is content that is part of a
structure element (indicated by the **MCID** entry in that property
list), and the language specification that applies to the latter content
is that of the structure element, English.

**14.9.2.4 Multi-language Text Arrays**

A *multi-language text array* *(PDF 1.5)* allows multiple text strings
to be specified, each in association with a language identifier. (See
the **Alt** entry in Tables 274 and 277 for examples of its use.)

A multi-language text array shall contain pairs of strings. The first
string in each pair shall be a language identifier (14.9.2.2, "Language
Identifiers"). A language identifier shall not appear more than once in
the array; any unrecognized language identifier shall be ignored. An
empty string specifies default text that may be used when no suitable
language identifier is found in the array. The second string is text
associated with the language.

EXAMPLE \[ (en-US) (My vacation) (fr) (mes vacances) ( ) (default text)
\]

When a conforming reader searches a multi-language text array to find
text for a given language, it shall look for an exact (though
case-insensitive) match between the given language's identifier and the
language identifiers in the array. If no exact match is found, prefix
matching shall be attempted in increasing array order: a match shall be
declared if the given identifier is a leading, case-insensitive,
substring of an identifier in the array, and the first post-substring
character in the array identifier is a hyphen. For example, given
identifier en matches array identifier en-US, but given identifier en-US
matches neither en nor en-GB. If no exact or prefix match can be found,
the default text (if any) should be used.

**14.9.3 Alternate Descriptions**

PDF documents may be enhanced by providing alternate descriptions for
images, formulas, or other items that do not translate naturally into
text.

NOTE 1 Alternate descriptions are human-readable text that could, for
example, be vocalized by a text-to-speech engine for the benefit of
users with visual impairments.

An alternate description may be specified for the following items:

- A structure element (see 14.7.2, "Structure Hierarchy"), through an
  **Alt** entry in the structure element dictionary

- *(PDF 1.5)* A marked-content sequence (see 14.6, "Marked Content"),
  through an **Alt** entry in a property list attached to the
  marked-content sequence with a Span tag.

- Any type of annotation (see 12.5, "Annotations") that does not already
  have a text representation, through a **Contents** entry in the
  annotation dictionary

For annotation types that normally display text, the **Contents** entry
of the annotation dictionary shall be used as the source for an
alternate description. For annotation types that do not display text, a
**Contents** entry *(PDF 1.4)* may be included to specify an alternate
description. Sound annotations, which need no alternate description for
the purpose of vocalization, may include a **Contents** entry specifying
a description that may be displayed for the benefit of users with
hearing impairments.

An alternate name may be specified for an interactive form field (see
12.7, "Interactive Forms") which, if present, shall be used in place of
the actual field name when a conforming reader identifies the field in a
userinterface. This alternate name, if provided, shall be specified
using the **TU** entry of the field dictionary.

NOTE 2 The **TU** entry is useful for vocalization purposes.

Alternate descriptions are text strings, which shall be encoded in
either **PDFDocEncoding** or Unicode character encoding.

NOTE 3 As described in 7.9.2.2, "Text String Type," Unicode defines an
escape sequence for indicating the language of the text. This mechanism
enables the alternate description to change from the language specified
by the prevailing **Lang** entry (as described in the preceding
sub-clause). Within alternate descriptions, Unicode escape sequences
specifying language shall override the prevailing Lang entry.

When applied to structure elements, the alternate description text shall
be considered to be a complete (or whole) word or phrase substitution
for the current element. If each of two (or more) elements in a sequence
have an **Alt** entry in their dictionaries, they shall be treated as if
a word break is present between them. The same applies to consecutive
marked-content sequences.

The **Alt** entry in property lists may be combined with other entries.

EXAMPLE This example shows the **Alt** entry combined with a **Lang**
entry.

> /Span \<\< /Lang (en-us) /Alt (six-point star) \>\> BDC (A) Tj EMC

**14.9.4 Replacement Text**

NOTE 1 Just as alternate descriptions can be provided for images and
other items that do not translate naturally into text (as described in
the preceding sub-clause), replacement text can be specified for content
that does translate into text but that is represented in a nonstandard
way. These nonstandard representations might include, for example,
glyphs for ligatures or custom characters, or inline graphics
corresponding to letters in an illuminated manuscript or to dropped
capitals.

Replacement text may be specified for the following items:

- A structure element (see 14.7.2, "Structure Hierarchy"), by means of
  the optional **ActualText** entry *(PDF*

> *1.4)* of the structure element dictionary.

- *(PDF 1.5)* A marked-content sequence (see 14.6, "Marked Content"),
  through an **ActualText** entry in a property list attached to the
  marked-content sequence with a Span tag.

The **ActualText** value shall be used as a replacement, not a
description, for the content, providing text that is equivalent to what
a person would see when viewing the content. The value of **ActualText**
shall be considered to be a character substitution for the structure
element or marked-content sequence. If each of two (or more) consecutive
structure or marked-content sequences has an **ActualText** entry, they
shall be treated as if no word break is present between them.

NOTE 2 The treatment of **ActualText** as a character replacement is
different from the treatment of **Alt**, which is treated as a whole
word or phrase substitution.

EXAMPLE This example shows the use of replacement text to indicate the
correct character content in a case where hyphenation changes the
spelling of a word (in German, up until recent spelling reforms, the
word "Drucker" when hyphenated was rendered as "Druk-" and "ker").

> (Dru) Tj
>
> /Span
>
> \<\</Actual Text (c) \>\>
>
> BDC
>
> (k-) Tj
>
> EMC
>
> (ker) \'

Like alternate descriptions (and other text strings), replacement text,
if encoded in Unicode, may include an escape sequence for indicating the
language of the text. Such a sequence shall override the prevailing
**Lang** entry (see 7.9.2.2, "Text String Type").

**14.9.5 Expansion of Abbreviations and Acronyms**

The expansion of an abbreviation or acronym may be specified for the
following items:

- Marked-content sequences, through an **E** property *(PDF 1.4)* in a
  property list attached to the sequence with a Span tag.

- Structure elements, through an **E** entry *(PDF 1.5)* in the
  structure element dictionary.

NOTE 1 Abbreviations and acronyms can pose a problem for text-to-speech
engines. Sometimes the full pronunciation for an abbreviation can be
divined without aid. For example, a dictionary search will probably
reveal that "Blvd." is pronounced "boulevard" and that "Ave." is
pronounced "avenue." However, some abbreviations are difficult to
resolve, as in the sentence "Dr. Healwell works at 123 Industrial Dr.".

EXAMPLE BT

> /Span \<\< /E ( Doctor ) \>\>
>
> BDC
>
> ( Dr. ) Tj
>
> EMC
>
> ( Healwell works at 123 Industrial ) Tj
>
> /Span \<\< /E ( Drive ) \>\>
>
> BDC
>
> ( Dr. ) Tj
>
> EMC
>
> ET

The **E** value (a text string) shall be considered to be a word or
phrase substitution for the tagged text and therefore shall be treated
as if a word break separates it from any surrounding text.The expansion
text, if encoded in Unicode, may include an escape sequence for
indicating the language of the text (see 7.9.2.2, "Text String Type").
Such a sequence shall override the prevailing Lang entry.

NOTE 2 Some abbreviations or acronyms are conventionally not expanded
into words. For the text "XYZ," for example, either no expansion should
be supplied (leaving its pronunciation up to the text-to-speech engine)
or, to be safe, the expansion "X Y Z" should be specified.

### 14.10 Web Capture

**14.10.1 General**

The information in the Web Capture data structures enables conforming
products to perform the following operations:

- Save locally and preserve the visual appearance of material from the
  Web

- Retrieve additional material from the Web and add it to an existing
  PDF file

- Update or modify existing material previously captured from the Web

- Find source information for material captured from the Web, such as
  the URL (if any) from which it was captured

- Find all material in a PDF file that was generated from a given URL

- Find all material in a PDF file that matches a given digital
  identifier (MD5 hash)

The information needed to perform these operations shall be recorded in
two data structures in the PDF file:

- The *Web Capture information dictionary*, which shall hold
  document-level information related to Web Capture.

- The *Web Capture content database*, which shall hold a complete
  registry of the source content resources retrieved by Web Capture and
  where it came from.

NOTE 3 The *Web Capture content database* enables the capturing process
to avoid downloading material that is already present in the file.

**14.10.2 Web Capture Information Dictionary**

The optional **SpiderInfo** entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2,
"Document Catalog"), if present, shall hold *Web Capture information
dictionary*.

|         |          | Dictionaries") describing commands that     |
|         |          | were used in building the PDF file. The     |
|         |          | commands shall appear in the array in the   |
|         |          | order in which they were executed in        |
|         |          | building the file.                          |
+---------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

**14.10.3 Content Database**

**14.10.3.1 General**

When a PDF file, or part of a PDF file, is built from a content resource
stored in another format, such as an HTML page, the resulting PDF file
(or portion thereof) may contain content from more than the single
content resources. Conversely, since many content formats do not have
static pagination, a single content resource may give rise to multiple
PDF pages.

To keep track of the correspondence between PDF content and the
resources from which the content was derived, a PDF file may contain a
*content database* that maps URLs and digital identifiers to PDF objects
such as pages and XObjects.

NOTE 4 By looking up digital identifiers in the database, Web Capture
can determine whether newly downloaded content is identical to content
already retrieved from a different URL. Thus, it can perform
optimizations such as storing only one copy of an image that is
referenced by multiple HTML pages.

Web Capture's content database shall be organized into *content sets*.
Each content set shall be a dictionary holding information about a group
of related PDF objects generated from the same source data. A content
set shall have for the value of its **S** (subtype) entry either the
value *SPS*, for a page set, or *SIS*, for an image set.

The mapping from a source content resource to a content set in a PDF
document may be saved in the PDF file. The mapping may be an association
from the resource\'s URL to the content set, stored in the PDF
document\'s URLS name tree. The mapping may also be an association from
a digital identifier (14.10.3.3, "Digital Identifiers") generated from
resource\'s data to the content set, stored in the PDF document\'s IDS
name tree. Both associations may be present in the PDF file.

> **Figure 84 -- Simple Web Capture file structure**

Entries in the **URLS** and **IDS** name trees may refer to an array of
content sets or a single content set. If the entry is an array, the
content sets need not have the same subtype; the array may include both
page sets and image sets.

> **Figure 85 -- Complex Web Capture file structure**

**14.10.3.2 URL Strings**

URLs associated with Web Capture content sets shall be reduced to a
predictable, canonical form before being used as keys in the **URLS**
name tree. The following steps describe how to perform this reduction,
using terminology from Internet RFCs 1738, *Uniform Resource Locators*,
and 1808, *Relative Uniform Resource Locators* (see the Bibliography).
This algorithm shall be applied for HTTP, FTP, and file URLs:

> **Algorithm: URL strings**

a)  If the URL is relative, it shall be converted into an absolute URL.

b)  If the URL contains one or more NUMBER SIGN (02h3) characters, it
    shall be truncated before the first NUMBER SIGN.

c)  Any uppercase ASCII characters within the scheme section of the URL
    shall be replaced with the corresponding lowercase ASCII characters.

d)  If there is a host section, any uppercase ASCII characters therein
    shall be converted to lowercase ASCII.

e)  If the scheme is file and the host is localhost, the host section
    shall be removed.

f)  If there is a port section and the port is the default port for the
    given protocol (80 for HTTP or 21 for FTP), the port section shall
    be removed.

g)  If the path section contains PERIOD (2Eh) ( . ) or DOUBLE PERIOD ( .
    . ) subsequences, transform the path as described in section 4 of
    RFC 1808.

NOTE Because the PERCENT SIGN (25h) is unsafe according to RFC 1738 and
is also the escape character for encoded characters, it is not possible
in general to distinguish a URL with unencoded characters from one with
encoded characters. For example, it is impossible to decide whether the
sequence *%00* represents a single encoded null character or a sequence
of three unencoded characters. Hence, no number of encoding or decoding
passes on a URL can ever cause it to reach a stable state. Empirically,
URLs embedded in HTML files have unsafe characters encoded with one
encoding pass, and Web servers perform one decoding pass on received
paths (though CGI scripts can make their own decisions).

Canonical URLs are thus assumed to have undergone one and only one
encoding pass. A URL whose initial encoding state is known can be safely
transformed into a URL that has undergone only one encoding pass.

**14.10.3.3 Digital Identifiers**

Digital identifiers, used to associate source content resources with
content sets by the **IDS** name tree, shall be generated using the MD5
message-digest algorithm (Internet RFC 1321).

NOTE 1 The exact data passed to the algorithm depends on the type of
content set and the nature of the identifier being calculated.

For a page set, the source data shall be passed to the MD5 algorithm
first, followed by strings representing the digital identifiers of any
auxiliary data files (such as images) referenced in the source data, in
the order in which they are first referenced. If an auxiliary file is
referenced more than once, its identifier shall be passed only the first
time. The resulting string shall be used as the digital identifier for
the source content resource.

NOTE 2 This sequence produces a composite identifier representing the
visual appearance of the pages in the page set.

NOTE 3 Two HTML source files that are identical, but for which the
referenced images contain different data---for example, if they have
been generated by a script or are pointed to by relative URLs---do not
produce the same identifier.

When the source data is a PDF file, the identifier shall be generated
solely from the contents of that file; there shall be no auxiliary data.

A page set may also have a *text identifier*, calculated by applying the
MD5 algorithm to just the text present in the source data.

EXAMPLE 1 For an HTML file the text identifier is based solely on the
text between markup tags; no images are used in the calculation.

For an image set, the digital identifier shall be calculated by passing
the source data for the original image to the MD5 algorithm.

EXAMPLE 2 The identifier for an image set created from a GIF image is
calculated from the contents of the GIF.

**14.10.3.4 Unique Name Generation**

In generating PDF pages from a data source, items such as hypertext
links and HTML form fields are converted into corresponding named
destinations and interactive form fields. These items shall be given
names that do not conflict with those of other such items in the file.

NOTE As used here, the term name refers to a string, not a name object.

Furthermore, when updating an existing file, a conforming processor
shall ensure that each destination or field is given a unique name that
shall be derived from its original name but constructed so that it
avoids conflicts with similarly named items elsewhere.

The unique name shall be formed by appending an encoded form of the page
set's digital identifier string to the original name of the destination
or field. The identifier string shall be encoded to remove characters
that have special meaning in destinations and fields. The characters
listed in the first column of Table 351 have special meaning and shall
be encoded using the corresponding byte values from second column of
Table 351.

> **Table 351 -- Characters with special meaning in destinations and
> fields and their byte values**

+---------------+---------+----------------+
| **Character** | **Byte  | **Escape       |
|               | value** | sequence**     |
+:==============+:========+:===============+
| > (nul)       | 0x00    | \\0 (0x5c      |
|               |         | 0x30)          |
+---------------+---------+----------------+
| . (PERIOD)    | 0x2e    | \\p (0x5c      |
|               |         | 0x70)          |
+---------------+---------+----------------+
| \\            | 0x5c    | \\\\ (0x5c     |
| (backslash)   |         | 0x5c)          |
+---------------+---------+----------------+

EXAMPLE Since the PERIOD character (2Eh) is used as the field separator
in interactive form field names, it does not appear in the identifier
portion of the unique name.

If the name is used for an interactive form field, there is an
additional encoding to ensure uniqueness and compatibility with
interactive forms. Each byte in the source string, encoded as described
previously, shall be replaced by two bytes in the destination string.
The first byte in each pair is 65 (corresponding to the ASCII character
A) plus the high-order 4 bits of the source byte; the second byte is 65
plus the low-order 4 bits of the source byte.

**14.10.4 Content Sets**

**14.10.4.1 General**

A Web Capture *content set* is a dictionary describing a set of PDF
objects generated from the same source data. It may include information
common to all the objects in the set as well as about the set itself.
Table 352 defines the contents of this type of dictionary.

**14.10.4.2 Page Sets**

A *page set* is a content set containing a group of PDF page objects
generated from a common source, such as an HTML file. The pages shall be
listed in the **O** array of the page set dictionary (see Table 352) in
the same order in which they were initially added to the file. A single
page object shall not belong to more than one page set. Table 353
defines the content set dictionary entries specific to Page Sets.

The **TID** (text identifier) entry may be used to store an identifier
generated from the text of the pages belonging to the page set (see
14.10.3.3, "Digital Identifiers"). A text identifier may not be
appropriate for some page sets (such as those with no text) and may be
omitted in these cases.

EXAMPLE This identifier may be used to determine whether the text of a
document has changed.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

**14.10.4.3 Image Sets**

An *image set* is a content set containing a group of image XObjects
generated from a common source, such as multiple frames of an animated
GIF image. A single XObject shall not belong to more than one image set.
Table 354 shows the content set dictionary entries specific to Image
Sets.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**   **Value**

                       this dictionary describes; shall be **SIS**.

  **R**     integer or *(Required)* The reference counts for the
            array      image XObjects belonging to the image set. For
                       an image set containing a single XObject, the
                       value shall be the integer reference count for
                       that XObject. For an image set containing
                       multiple XObjects, the value shall be an array
                       of reference counts parallel to the **O**
                       array (see Table 352); that is, each element
                       in the **R** array shall hold the reference
                       count for the image XObject at the
                       corresponding position in the **O** array.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

Each image XObject in an image set has a reference count indicating the
number of PDF pages referring to that XObject. The reference count shall
be incremented whenever Web Capture creates a new page referring to the
XObject (including copies of already existing pages) and decremented
whenever such a page is destroyed. The reference count shall be
incremented or decremented only once per page, regardless of the number
of times the XObject may be referenced by that page. If the reference
count reaches 0, it shall be assumed that there are no remaining pages
referring to the XObject and that the XObject can be removed from the
image set's **O** array. When removing an XObject from the O array of an
image set, the corresponding entry in the R array shall be removed also.

**14.10.5 Source Information**

**14.10.5.1 General**

The **SI** entry in a content set dictionary (see Table 352) shall
contain one or more *source information dictionaries*, each containing
information about the locations from which the source data for the
content set was retrieved.

|         |            | information dictionaries associated with   |
|         |            | page sets. Default value: 0.               |
+---------+------------+--------------------------------------------+
| **C**   | dictionary | *(Optional; if present, shall be an        |
|         |            | indirect reference)* A command dictionary  |
|         |            | (see 14.10.5.3, "Command Dictionaries")    |
|         |            | describing the command that caused the     |
|         |            | source data to be retrieved. This entry    |
|         |            | may be present only in source information  |
|         |            | dictionaries associated with page sets.    |
+---------+------------+--------------------------------------------+

A content set\'s **SI** entry may contain a single source information
dictionary. However, a PDF processor may attempt to detect situations in
which the same source data has been located via two or more distinct
URLs. If a processor detects such a situation, it may generate a single
content set from the source data, containing a single copy of the
relevant PDF pages or image XObjects. In this case, the **SI** entry
shall be an array containing one source information dictionary for each
distinct URL from which the original source content was found.

The determination that distinct URLs produce the same source data shall
be made by comparing digital identifiers for the source data.

A source information dictionary's **AU** (aliased URLs) entry shall
identify the URLs from which the source data was retrieved. If there is
only one such URL, the *v* value of this entry may be a string. If
multiple URLs map to the same location through redirection, the **AU**
value shall be a URL alias dictionary (see 14.10.5.2, "URL Alias
Dictionaries").

NOTE 1 For file size efficiency, the entire URL alias dictionary
(excluding the URL strings) should be represented as a direct object
because its internal structure should never be shared or externally
referenced.

The **TS** (time stamp) entry allows each source location associated
with a content set to have its own time stamp.

NOTE 2 This is necessary because the time stamp in the content set
dictionary (see Table 352) merely refers to the creation date of the
content set. A hypothetical "Update Content Set" command might reset the
time stamp in the source information dictionary to the current time if
it found that the source data had not changed since the time stamp was
last set.

The **E** (expiration) entry specifies an expiration date for each
source location associated with a content set. If the current date and
time are later than those specified, the contents of the content set
shall be considered out of date with respect to the original source.

**14.10.5.2 URL Alias Dictionaries**

When a URL is accessed via HTTP, a response header may be returned
indicating that the requested data is at a different URL. This
*redirection* process may be repeated in turn at the new URL and can
potentially continue indefinitely. It is not uncommon to find multiple
URLs that all lead eventually to the same destination through one or
more redirections. A URL alias dictionary represents such a set of URL
chains leading to a common destination. Table 356 shows the contents of
this type of dictionary.

> **Table 356 -- Entries in a URL alias dictionary**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**   **Value**
  --------- ---------- ----------------------------------------------
  **U**     ASCII      *(Required)* The destination URL to which all
            string     of the chains specified by the **C** entry
                       lead.

  **C**     array      *(Optional)* An array of one or more arrays of
                       strings, each representing a chain of URLs
                       leading to the common destination specified by
                       **U**.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

The **C** (chains) entry may be omitted if the URL alias dictionary
contains only one URL. If **C** is present, its value shall be an array
of arrays, each representing a chain of URLs leading to the common
destination. Within each chain, the URLs shall be stored as ASCII
strings in the order in which they occur in the redirection sequence.
The common destination (the last URL in a chain) may be omitted, since
it is already identified by the **U** entry.

**14.10.5.3 Command Dictionaries**

A Web Capture *command dictionary* represents a command executed by Web
Capture to retrieve one or more pieces of source data that were used to
create new pages or modify existing pages. The entries in this
dictionary represent parameters that were originally specified
interactively by the user who requested that the Web content be
captured. This information is recorded so that the command can
subsequently be repeated to update the captured content. Table 357 shows
the contents of this type of dictionary.

> **Table 357 -- Entries in a Web Capture command dictionary**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**    **Value**
  --------- ----------- -----------------------------------------
  **URL**   ASCII       *(Required)* The initial URL from which
            string      source data was requested.

  **L**     integer     *(Optional)* The number of levels of
                        pages retrieved from the initial URL.
                        Default value: 1.

  **F**     integer     *(Optional)* A set of flags specifying
                        various characteristics of the command
                        (see Table 357). Defaut value: 0.

  **P**     string or   *(Optional)* Data that was posted to the
            stream      URL.

  **CT**    ASCII       *(Optional)* A content type describing
            string      the data posted to the URL. Default
                        value: application /
                        x-www-form-urlencoded.

  **H**     string      *(Optional)* Additional HTTP request
                        headers sent to the URL.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**     **Value**
  --------- ------------ -----------------------------------------
  **S**     dictionary   *(Optional)* A command settings
                         dictionary containing settings used in
                         the conversion process (see 14.10.5.4,
                         "Command Settings").

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

The **URL** entry shall contain the initial URL for the retrieval
command. The **L** (levels) entry shall contain the number of levels of
the hyperlinked URL hierarchy to follow from this URL, creating PDF
pages from the retrieved material. If the **L** entry is omitted, its
value shall be assumed to be 1, denoting retrieval of the initial URL
only.

The value of the command dictionary's **F** entry shall be an integer
that shall be interpreted as an array of flags specifying various
characteristics of the command. The flags shall be interpreted as
defined in Table 358. Only those flags defined in Table 358 may be set
to 1; all other flags shall be 0. Flags not defined in Table 358 are
reserved for future use, and shall not be used by a conforming reader.

NOTE 3 The low-order bit of the flags value is referred to as being at
bit-position 1.

> **Table 358 -- Web Capture command flags**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Bit        **Name**   **Meaning**
  position**              
  ------------ ---------- ---------------------------------------
  1            SameSite   If set, pages were retrieved only from
                          the host specified in the initial URL.

  2            SamePath   If set, pages were retrieved only from
                          the path specified in the initial URL.

  3            Submit     If set, the command represents a form
                          submission.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

The SamePath flag shall be set if the retrieval of source content was
restricted to source content in the same path as specified in the
initial URL. Source content shall be considered to be in the same path
if its scheme and network location components (as defined in Internet
RFC 1808, *Relative Uniform Resource Locators*) match those of the
initial URL and its path component matches up to and including the last
forward slash ( / ) character in the initial URL.

EXAMPLE 1 the URL

> http : / / www . adobe . com / fiddle / faddle / foo . html
>
> is considered to be in the same path as the initial URL
>
> http : / / www . adobe . com / fiddle / initial . html

The comparison shall be case-insensitive for the scheme and network
location components and case-sensitive for the path component.

The Submit flag shall be set when the command represents a form
submission. If no **P** (posted data) entry is present, the submitted
data shall be encoded in the URL (an HTTP GET request). If **P** is
present, the command shall be an HTTP POST request. In this case, the
value of the Submit flag shall be ignored.

NOTE 4 If the posted data is small enough, it may be represented by a
string. For large amounts of data, a stream should be used because it
can be compressed.

The **CT** (content type) entry shall only be present for POST requests.
It shall describe the content type of the posted data, as described in
Internet RFC 2045, *Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), Part
One: Format of Internet Message Bodies* (see the Bibliography).

The **H** (headers) entry, if present, shall specify additional HTTP
request headers that were sent in the request for the URL. Each header
line in the string shall be terminated with a CARRIAGE RETURN and a LINE
FEED, as in this example:

EXAMPLE 2 ( Referer : http : / / frumble . com \\ 015 \\ 012From :
veeble @ frotz . com \\ 015 \\ 012 )

The HTTP request header format is specified in Internet RFC 2616,
*Hypertext Transfer Protocol---HTTP/1.1* (see the Bibliography).

The **S** (settings) entry specifies a command settings dictionary (see
14.10.5.4, "Command Settings"). Holding settings specific to the
conversion engines.

**14.10.5.4 Command Settings**

The **S** (settings) entry in a command dictionary, if present, shall
contain a *command settings dictionary*, which holds settings for
conversion engines that shall be used in converting the results of the
command to PDF. Table 359 shows the contents of this type of dictionary.
If this entry is omitted, default values are assumed. Command settings
dictionaries may be shared by any command dictionaries that use the same
settings.

> **Table 359 -- Entries in a Web Capture command settings dictionary**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**     **Value**
  --------- ------------ ---------------------------------------------
  **G**     dictionary   *(Optional)* A dictionary containing global
                         conversion engine settings relevant to all
                         conversion engines. If this entry is absent,
                         default settings shall be used.

  **C**     dictionary   *(Optional)* Settings for specific conversion
                         engines. Each key in this dictionary is the
                         internal name of a conversion engine. The
                         associated value is a dictionary containing
                         the settings associated with that conversion
                         engine. If the settings for a particular
                         conversion engine are not found in the
                         dictionary, default settings shall be used.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

Each key in the **C** dictionary represents the internal name of a
conversion engine, which shall be a name object of the following form:

/ *company* : *product* : *version* : *contentType* where *company*
denotes the name (or abbreviation) of the company that created the
conversion engine.

> *product* denotes the name of the conversion engine. This field may be
> left blank, but the trailing COLON character (3Ah) is still required.
> *version* denotes the version of the conversion engine.
>
> *contentType* denotes an identifier for the content type the
> associated settings. shall be used because some converters may handle
> multiple content types.

EXAMPLE / ADBE : H2PDF : 1 . 0 : HTML

All fields in the internal name are case-sensitive. The company field
shall conform to the naming guidelines described in Annex E. The values
of the other fields shall be unrestricted, except that they shall not
contain a

COLON.

The directed graph of PDF objects rooted by the command settings
dictionary shall be entirely self-contained; that is, it shall not
contain any object referred to from elsewhere in the PDF file.

NOTE This facilitates the operation of making a deep copy of a command
settings dictionary without explicit knowledge of the settings it may
contain.

**14.10.6 Object Attributes Related to Web Capture**

A given page object or image XObject may belong to at most one Web
Capture content set, called its *parent content set*. However, the
object shall not have direct pointer to its parent content set. Such a
pointer may present problems for an application that traces all pointers
from an object to determine what resources the object depends on.
Instead, the object's **ID** entry (see Table 30 and Table 89) contains
the digital identifier of the parent content set, which shall be used to
locate the parent content set via the **IDS** name tree in the
document's name dictionary. (If the **IDS** entry for the identifier
contains an array of content sets, the parent may be found by searching
the array for the content set whose **O** entry includes the child
object.)

In the course of creating PDF pages from HTML files, Web Capture
frequently scales the contents down to fit on fixed-sized pages. The
**PZ** (preferred zoom) entry in a page object (see 7.7.3.3, "Page
Objects") specifies a magnification factor by which the page may be
scaled to undo the downscaling and view the page at its original size.
That is, when the page is viewed at the preferred magnification factor,
one unit in default user space corresponds to one original source pixel.

### 14.11Prepress Support

**14.11.1 General**

This sub-clause describes features of PDF that support prepress
production workflows:

- The specification of *page boundaries* governing various aspects of
  the prepress process, such as cropping, bleed, and trimming (14.11.2,
  "Page Boundaries")

- Facilities for including *printer's marks*, such as registration
  targets, gray ramps, colour bars, and cut marks to assist in the
  production process (14.11.3, "Printer's Marks")

- Information for generating *colour separations* for pages in a
  document (14.11.4, "Separation Dictionaries")

- *Output intents* for matching the colour characteristics of a document
  with those of a target output device or production environment in
  which it will be printed (14.11.5, "Output Intents")

- Support for the generation of *traps* to minimize the visual effects
  of misregistration between multiple colorants (14.11.6, "Trapping
  Support")

- The *Open Prepress Interface (OPI)* for creating low-resolution
  proxies for high-resolution images (14.11.7, "Open Prepress Interface
  (OPI)")

**14.11.2 Page Boundaries**

**14.11.2.1 General**

A PDF page may be prepared either for a finished medium, such as a sheet
of paper, or as part of a prepress process in which the content of the
page is placed on an intermediate medium, such as film or an imposed
reproduction plate. In the latter case, it is important to distinguish
between the intermediate page and the finished page. The intermediate
page may often include additional production-related content, such as
bleeds or printer marks, that falls outside the boundaries of the
finished page. To handle such cases, a PDF page may define as many as
five separate boundaries to control various aspects of the imaging
process:

- The *media box* defines the boundaries of the physical medium on which
  the page is to be printed. It may include any extended area
  surrounding the finished page for bleed, printing marks, or other such
  purposes. It may also include areas close to the edges of the medium
  that cannot be marked because of physical limitations of the output
  device. Content falling outside this boundary may safely be discarded
  without affecting the meaning of the PDF file.

- The *crop box* defines the region to which the contents of the page
  shall be clipped (cropped) when displayed or printed. Unlike the other
  boxes, the crop box has no defined meaning in terms of physical page
  geometry or intended use; it merely imposes clipping on the page
  contents. However, in the absence of additional information (such as
  imposition instructions specified in a JDF or PJTF job ticket), the
  crop box determines how the page's contents shall be positioned on the
  output medium. The default value is the page's media box.

- The *bleed box (PDF 1.3)* defines the region to which the contents of
  the page shall be clipped when output in a production environment.
  This may include any extra bleed area needed to accommodate the
  physical limitations of cutting, folding, and trimming equipment. The
  actual printed page may include printing marks that fall outside the
  bleed box. The default value is the page's crop box.

- The *trim box (PDF 1.3)* defines the intended dimensions of the
  finished page after trimming. It may be smaller than the media box to
  allow for production-related content, such as printing instructions,
  cut marks, or colour bars. The default value is the page's crop box.

- The *art box (PDF 1.3)* defines the extent of the page's meaningful
  content (including potential white space) as intended by the page's
  creator. The default value is the page's crop box.

The page object dictionary specifies these boundaries in the
**MediaBox**, **CropBox**, **BleedBox**, **TrimBox**, and **ArtBox**
entries, respectively (see Table 30). All of them are rectangles
expressed in default user space units. The crop, bleed, trim, and art
boxes shall not ordinarily extend beyond the boundaries of the media
box. If they do, they are effectively reduced to their intersection with
the media box. Figure 86 illustrates the relationships among these
boundaries. (The crop box is not shown in the figure because it has no
defined relationship with any of the other boundaries.)

> height="5.733333333333333in"}
>
> **Figure 86 -- Page boundaries**

NOTE 1 How the various boundaries are used depends on the purpose to
which the page is being put. The following are typical purposes:

> *Placing the content of a page in another application.* The art box
> determines the boundary of the content that is to be placed in the
> application. Depending on the applicable usage conventions, the placed
> content may be clipped to either the art box or the bleed box. For
> example, a quarter-page advertisement to be placed on a magazine page
> might be clipped to the art box on the two sides of the ad that face
> into the middle of the page and to the bleed box on the two sides that
> bleed over the edge of the page. The media box and trim box are
> ignored.
>
> *Printing a finished page.* This case is typical of desktop or shared
> page printers, in which the page content is positioned directly on the
> final output medium. The art box and bleed box are ignored. The media
> box may be used as advice for selecting media of the appropriate size.
> The crop box and trim box, if present, should be the same as the media
> box.
>
> *Printing an intermediate page for use in a prepress process.* The art
> box is ignored. The bleed box defines the boundary of the content to
> be imaged. The trim box specifies the positioning of the content on
> the medium; it may also be used to generate cut or fold marks outside
> the bleed box. Content falling within the media box but outside the
> bleed box may or may not be imaged, depending on the specific
> production process being used.
>
> *Building an imposition of multiple pages on a press sheet.* The art
> box is ignored. The bleed box defines the clipping boundary of the
> content to be imaged; content outside the bleed box is ignored. The
> trim box specifies the positioning of the page's content within the
> imposition. Cut and fold marks are typically generated for the
> imposition as a whole.

NOTE 2 In the preceding scenarios, an application that interprets the
bleed, trim, and art boxes for some purpose typically alters the crop
box so as to impose the clipping that those boxes prescribe.

**14.11.2.2 Display of Page Boundaries**

Conforming readers may offer the ability to display guidelines on the
screen for the various page boundaries. The optional **BoxColorInfo**
entry in a page object (see 7.7.3.3, "Page Objects") holds a *box colour
information dictionary (PDF 1.4)* specifying the colours and other
visual characteristics to be used for such display. Conforming readers
typically provide a user interface to allow the user to set these
characteristics interactively.

NOTE This information is page-specific and may vary from one page to
another.

As shown in Table 360, the box colour information dictionary contains an
optional entry for each of the possible page boundaries other than the
media box. The value of each entry is a *box style dictionary*, whose
contents are shown in Table 361. If a given entry is absent, the
conforming reader shall use its own current default settings instead.

**14.11.3 Printer's Marks**

*Printer's marks* are graphic symbols or text added to a page to assist
production personnel in identifying components of a multiple-plate job
and maintaining consistent output during production. Examples commonly
used in the printing industry include:

- Registration targets for aligning plates

- Gray ramps and colour bars for measuring colours and ink densities

- Cut marks showing where the output medium is to be trimmed

Although conforming writers traditionally include such marks in the
content stream of a document, they are logically separate from the
content of the page itself and typically appear outside the boundaries
(the crop box, trim box, and art box) defining the extent of that
content (see 14.11.2, "Page Boundaries").

*Printer's mark annotations (PDF 1.4)* provide a mechanism for
incorporating printer's marks into the PDF representation of a page,
while keeping them separate from the actual page content. Each page in a
PDF document may contain any number of such annotations, each of which
represents a single printer's mark.

NOTE 1 Because printer's marks typically fall outside the page's content
boundaries, each mark is represented as a separate annotation.
Otherwise---if, for example, the cut marks at the four corners of the
page were defined in a single annotation---the annotation rectangle
would encompass the entire contents of the page and could interfere with
the user's ability to select content or interact with other annotations
on the page. Defining printer's marks in separate annotations also
facilitates the implementation of a drag-and-drop user interface for
specifying them.

The visual presentation of a printer's mark shall be defined by a form
XObject specified as an appearance stream in the **N** (normal) entry of
the printer's mark annotation's appearance dictionary (see 12.5.5,
"Appearance Streams"). More than one appearance may be defined for the
same printer's mark to meet the requirements of different regions or
production facilities. In this case, the appearance dictionary's **N**
entry holds a subdictionary containing the alternate appearances, each
identified by an arbitrary key. The **AS** (appearance state) entry in
the annotation dictionary designates one of them to be displayed or
printed.

NOTE 2 The printer's mark annotation's appearance dictionary may include
***R*** (rollover) or ***D*** (down) entries, but appearances defined in
either of these entries are never displayed or printed.

Like all annotations, a printer's mark annotation shall be defined by an
annotation dictionary (see 12.5.2, "Annotation Dictionaries"); its
annotation type is **PrinterMark**. The **AP** (appearances) and **F**
(flags) entries (which ordinarily are optional) shall be present, as
shall the **AS** (appearance state) entry if the appearance dictionary
**AP** contains more than one appearance stream. The Print and ReadOnly
flags in the **F** entry shall be set and all others clear (see 12.5.3,
"Annotation Flags"). Table 362 shows an additional annotation dictionary
entry specific to this type of annotation.

  **Subtype**   name       *(Required)* The type of annotation that
                           this dictionary describes; shall be
                           **PrinterMark** for a printer's mark
                           annotation.

  **MN**        name       *(Optional)* An arbitrary name identifying
                           the type of printer's mark, such as
                           ColorBar or RegistrationTarget.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

The form dictionary defining a printer's mark may contain the optional
entries shown in Table 363 in addition to the standard ones common to
all form dictionaries (see 8.10.2, "Form Dictionaries").

  **MarkStyle**   text string  *(Optional; PDF 1.4)* A text string
                               representing the printer's mark in
                               human-readable form and suitable for
                               presentation to the user.

  **Colorants**   dictionary   *(Optional; PDF 1.4)* A dictionary
                               identifying the individual colorants
                               associated with a printer's mark, such
                               as a colour bar. For each entry in
                               this dictionary, the key is a colorant
                               name and the value is an array
                               defining a **Separation** colour space
                               for that colorant (see 8.6.6.4,
                               "Separation Colour Spaces"). The key
                               shall match the colorant name given in
                               that colour space.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

**14.11.4 Separation Dictionaries**

In high-end printing workflows, pages are ultimately produced as sets of
*separations*, one per colorant (see 8.6.6.4, "Separation Colour
Spaces"). Ordinarily, each page in a PDF file shall be treated as a
composite page that paints graphics objects using all the process
colorants and perhaps some spot colorants as well. In other words, all
separations for a page shall be generated from a single PDF description
of that page.

In some workflows, however, pages are *preseparated* before generating
the PDF file. In a preseparated PDF file, the separations for a page
shall be described as separate page objects, each painting only a single
colorant (usually specified in the **DeviceGray** colour space). In this
case, additional information is needed to identify the actual colorant
associated with each separation and to group together the page objects
representing all the separations for a given page. This information
shall be contained in a *separation dictionary (PDF 1.3)* in the
**SeparationInfo** entry of each page object (see 7.7.3.3, "Page
Objects"). Table 364 shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

                                  references to page objects representing
                                  separations of the same document page.
                                  One of the page objects in the array
                                  shall be the one with which this
                                  separation dictionary is associated, and
                                  all of them shall have separation
                                  dictionaries (**SeparationInfo** entries)
                                  containing **Pages** arrays identical to
                                  this one.

  **DeviceColorant**   name or    *(Required)* The name of the device
                       string     colorant to be used in rendering this
                                  separation, such as Cyan or PANTONE 35
                                  CV.

|                |          | Spaces"). It provides additional       |
|                |          | information about the colour specified |
|                |          | by **DeviceColorant**---in particular, |

|                |          | enables a conforming reader to preview |
|                |          | the separation in a colour that        |
|                |          | approximates the device colorant.      |

|                |          | is a **Separation** space) or be one   |
|                |          | of the space's colorant names (if it   |

**14.11.5 Output Intents**

*Output intents (PDF 1.4)* provide a means for matching the colour
characteristics of a PDF document with those of a target output device
or production environment in which the document will be printed. The
optional **OutputIntents** entry in the document catalogue (see 7.7.2,
"Document Catalog") holds an array of *output intent dictionaries*, each
describing the colour reproduction characteristics of a possible output
device or production condition. The contents of these dictionaries may
vary for different devices and conditions. The dictionary's **S** entry
specifies an *output intent subtype* that determines the format and
meaning of the remaining entries.

NOTE 1 This use of multiple output intents allows the production process
to be customized to the expected workflow and the specific tools
available. For example, one production facility might process files
conforming to a recognized standard such as PDF/X-1, while another uses
the PDF/A standard to produce RGB output for document distribution on
the Web. Each of these workflows would require different sets of output
intent information. Multiple output intents also allow the same PDF file
to be distributed unmodified to multiple production facilities. The
choice of which output intent to use in a given production environment
is a matter for agreement between the purchaser and provider of
production services. PDF intentionally does not include a selector for
choosing a particular output intent from within the PDF file.

At the time of publication, three output intent subtypes have been
defined: **GTS_PDFX** corresponding to the PDF/X format standard
specified in ISO 15930, **GTS_PDFA1** corresponding to the PDF/A
standard as defined by ISO 19005, and ISO_PDFE1 corresponding to the
PDF/E standard as defined by ISO 24517. Table 365 shows the contents of
this type of output intent dictionary. Other subtypes may be added in
the future; the names of any such additional subtypes shall conform to
the naming guidelines described in Annex E.

                                   *ISO_PDFE1* or a key defined by
                                   an ISO 32000 extension.

  **OutputCondition**   text       *(Optional)* A text string
                        string     concisely identifying the

                                   production condition in
                                   human-readable form. This is the
                                   preferred method of defining such
                                   a string for presentation to the
                                   user.

NOTE 2 PDF/X is actually a family of standards representing varying
levels of conformance. The standard for a given conformance level may
prescribe further restrictions on the usage and meaning of entries in
the output intent dictionary. Any such restrictions take precedence over
the descriptions given in Table 364.

The ICC profile information in an output intent dictionary supplements
rather than replaces that in an **ICCBased** or default colour space
(see 8.6.5.5, "ICCBased Colour Spaces," and 8.6.5.6, "Default Colour
Spaces"). Those mechanisms are specifically intended for describing the
characteristics of source colour component values. An output intent can
be used in conjunction with them to convert source colours to those
required for a specific production condition or to enable the display or
proofing of the intended output.

The data in an output intent dictionary shall be provided for
informational purposes only, and conforming readers are free to
disregard it. In particular, there is no expectation that PDF production
tools automatically convert colours expressed in the same source colour
space to the specified target space before generating output. (In some
workflows, such conversion may, in fact, be undesirable).

+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE    | When working with *CMYK* source colours tagged with a source    |
|         | ICC profile solely for purposes of characterization, converting |
|         | such colours from four components to three and back is          |
|         | unnecessary and will result in a loss of fidelity in the values |
|         | of the black component; see 8.6.5.7, "Implicit Conversion of    |
|         | CIE-Based Colour Spaces" for further discussion.) On the other  |
|         | hand, when source colours are expressed in different base       |
|         | colour spaces---for example, when combining separately          |
|         | generated images on the same PDF page---it is possible (though  |
|         | not required) to use the destination profile specified in the   |
|         | output intent dictionary to convert source colours to the same  |
|         | target colour space.                                            |

**14.11.6 Trapping Support**

**14.11.6.1 General**

On devices such as offset printing presses, which mark multiple
colorants on a single sheet of physical medium, mechanical limitations
of the device can cause imprecise alignment, or *misregistration*,
between colorants. This can produce unwanted visual artifacts such as
brightly coloured gaps or bands around the edges of printed objects. In
high-quality reproduction of colour documents, such artifacts are
commonly avoided by creating an overlap, called a *trap*, between areas
of adjacent colour.

NOTE Figure 87 shows an example of trapping. The light and medium grays
represent two different colorants, which are used to paint the
background and the glyph denoting the letter A. The first figure shows
the intended result, with the two colorants properly registered. The
second figure shows what happens when the colorants are misregistered.
In the third figure, traps have been overprinted along the boundaries,
obscuring the artifacts caused by the misregistration. (For emphasis,
the traps are shown here in dark gray; in actual practice, their colour
will be similar to one of the adjoining colours.)

> **Figure 87 -- Trapping example**

Trapping may be implemented by the application generating a PDF file, by
some intermediate application that adds traps to a PDF document, or by
the raster image processor (RIP) that produces final output. In the last
two cases, the trapping process is controlled by a set of *trapping
instructions*, which define two kinds of information:

- *Trapping zones* within which traps should be created

- *Trapping parameters* specifying the nature of the traps within each
  zone

Trapping zones and trapping parameters are discussed fully in Sections
6.3.2 and 6.3.3, respectively, of the *PostScript Language Reference*,
Third Edition. Trapping instructions are not directly specified in a PDF
file (as they are in a PostScript file). Instead, they shall be
specified in a *job ticket* that accompanies the PDF file or is embedded
within it. Various standards exist for the format of job tickets; two of
them, JDF (Job Definition Format) and PJTF (Portable Job Ticket Format),
are described in the CIP4 document *JDF Specification* and in Adobe
Technical Note #5620, *Portable Job Ticket Format* (see the
Bibliography).

When trapping is performed before the production of final output, the
resulting traps shall be placed in the PDF file for subsequent use. The
traps themselves shall be described as a content stream in a trap
network annotation (see 14.11.6.2, "Trap Network Annotations"). The
stream dictionary may include additional entries describing the method
that was used to produce the traps and other information about their
appearance.

**14.11.6.2 Trap Network Annotations**

A complete set of traps generated for a given page under a specified set
of trapping instructions is called a *trap network (PDF 1.3)*. It is a
form XObject containing graphics objects for painting the required traps
on the page. A page may have more than one trap network based on
different trapping instructions, presumably intended for different
output devices. All of the trap networks for a given page shall be
contained in a single *trap network annotation* (see 12.5,
"Annotations"). There may be at most one trap network annotation per
page, which shall be the last element in the page's **Annots** array
(see 7.7.3.3, "Page Objects"). This ensures that the trap network shall
be printed after all of the page's other contents.

The form XObject defining a trap network shall be specified as an
appearance stream in the **N** (normal) entry of the trap network
annotation's appearance dictionary (see 12.5.5, "Appearance Streams").
If more than one trap network is defined for the same page, the **N**
entry holds a subdictionary containing the alternate trap networks, each
identified by an arbitrary key. The **AS** (appearance state) entry in
the annotation dictionary designates one of them as the *current trap
network* to be displayed or printed.

NOTE 1 The trap network annotation's appearance dictionary may include
***R*** (rollover) or ***D*** (down) entries, but appearances defined in
either of these entries are never printed.

Like all annotations, a trap network annotation shall be defined by an
annotation dictionary (see 12.5.2, "Annotation Dictionaries"); its
annotation type is **TrapNet**. The **AP** (appearances), **AS**
(appearance state), and **F** (flags) entries (which ordinarily are
optional) shall be present, with the Print and ReadOnly flags set and
all others clear (see 12.5.3, "Annotation Flags"). Table 366 shows the
additional annotation dictionary entries specific to this type of
annotation.

The **Version** and **AnnotStates** entries, if present, shall be used
to detect changes in the content of a page that might require
regenerating its trap networks. The **Version** array identifies
elements of the page's content that might be changed by an editing
application and thus invalidate its trap networks. Because there is at
most one **Version** array per trap network annotation (and thus per
page), any conforming writer that generates a new trap network shall
also verify the validity of existing trap networks by enumerating the
objects identified in the array and verifying that the results exactly
match the array's current contents. Any trap networks found to be
invalid shall be regenerated.

The **LastModified** entry may be used in place of the **Version** array
to track changes to a page's trap network. (The trap network annotation
shall include either a **LastModified** entry or the combination of
**Version** and **AnnotStates**, but not all three.) If the modification
date in the **LastModified** entry of the page object (see 7.7.3.3,
"Page Objects") is more recent than the one in the trap network
annotation dictionary, the page's trap networks are invalid and shall be
regenerated.

NOTE 2 Not all editing applications correctly maintain these
modification dates.

This method of tracking trap network modifications may be used reliably
only in a controlled workflow environment where the integrity of the
modification dates is assured.

**14.11.6.3 Trap Network Appearances**

Each entry in the **N** (normal) subdictionary of a trap network
annotation's appearance dictionary holds an appearance stream defining a
trap network associated with the given page. Like all appearances, a
trap network is a stream object defining a form XObject (see 8.10, "Form
XObjects"). The body of the stream contains the graphics objects needed
to paint the traps making up the trap network. Its dictionary entries
include, besides the standard entries for a form dictionary, the
additional entries shown in Table 367.

NOTE Preseparated PDF files (see 14.11.4, "Separation Dictionaries") may
not be trapped because traps are defined along the borders between
different colours and a preseparated file uses only one colour.
Therefore, preseparation shall occur after trapping, not before. An
conforming writer that preseparates a trapped PDF file is responsible
for calculating new ***Version*** arrays for the separated trap
networks.

**14.11.7 Open Prepress Interface (OPI)**

The workflow in a prepress environment often involves multiple
applications in areas such as graphic design, page layout, word
processing, photo manipulation, and document construction. As pieces of
the final document are moved from one application to another, it is
useful to separate the data of high-resolution images, which can be
quite large---in some cases, many times the size of the rest of the
document combined---from that of the document itself. The *Open Prepress
Interface (OPI)* is a mechanism, originally developed by Aldus
Corporation, for creating low-resolution placeholders, or *proxies*, for
such high-resolution images. The proxy typically consists of a
downsampled version of the full-resolution image, to be used for screen
display and proofing. Before the document is printed, it passes through
a filter known as an *OPI server*, which replaces the proxies with the
original full-resolution images.

NOTE 1 In PostScript programs, OPI proxies are defined by PostScript
code surrounded by special OPI comments, which specify such information
as the placement and cropping of the image and adjustments to its size,
rotation, colour, and other attributes.

In PDF, proxies shall be embedded in a document as image or form
XObjects with an associated *OPI dictionary (PDF 1.2).* This dictionary
contains the same information that the OPI comments convey in
PostScript. Two versions of OPI shall be supported, versions 1.3 and
2.0. In OPI 1.3, a proxy consisting of a single image, with no changes
in the graphics state, may be represented as an image XObject; otherwise
it shall be a form XObject. In OPI 2.0, the proxy always entails changes
in the graphics state and hence shall be represented as a form XObject.

An XObject representing an OPI proxy shall contain an **OPI** entry in
its image or form dictionary (see Table 89 and Table 95). The value of
this entry is an *OPI version dictionary* (Table 368) identifying the
version of OPI to which the proxy corresponds. This dictionary consists
of a single entry, whose key is the name **1.3** or **2.0** and whose
value is the OPI dictionary defining the proxy's OPI attributes.

> **Table 368 -- Entry in an OPI version dictionary**

  --------------------------------------------------------------
  **Key**   **Type**     **Value**
  --------- ------------ ---------------------------------------
  version   dictionary   *(Required; PDF 1.2)* An OPI dictionary
  number                 specifying the attributes of this proxy
                         (see Tables 369 and 370). The key for
                         this entry shall be the name **1.3** or
                         **2.0**, identifying the version of OPI
                         to which the proxy corresponds.

  --------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 As in any other PDF dictionary, the key in an OPI version
dictionary is a name object. The OPI version dictionary would thus be
written in the PDF file in either the form

> \<\< /1 . 3 *d* 0 R \>\>% OPI 1 . 3 dictionary
>
> or
>
> \<\< /2 . 0 *d* 0 R \>\>% OPI 2 . 0 dictionary
>
> where *d* is the object number of the corresponding OPI dictionary.

Table 369 and Table 370 describe the contents of the OPI dictionaries
for OPI 1.3 and OPI 2.0, respectively, along with the corresponding
PostScript OPI comments. The dictionary entries shall be listed in the
order in which the corresponding OPI comments appear in a PostScript
program. Complete details on the meanings of these entries and their
effects on OPI servers can be found in *OPI: Open Prepress Interface
Specification 1.3* and Adobe Technical Note #5660, *Open Prepress
Interface (OPI) Specification, Version 2.0*.

**Implementation Limits**

### C.1 General

In general, PDF does not restrict the size or quantity of things
described in the file format, such as numbers, arrays, images, and so
on. However, a conforming reader running on a particular processor and
in a particular operating environment does have such limits. If a
conforming reader encounters a PDF construct that exceeds one of these
limits or performs a computation whose intermediate results exceed a
limit, an error occurs.

NOTE PostScript interpreters also have implementation limits, listed in
Appendix B of the *PostScript Language Reference*, Third Edition. It is
possible to construct a PDF file that does not violate PDF
implementation limits but fails to print on a PostScript printer. Keep
in mind that these limits vary according to the PostScript
LanguageLevel, interpreter version, and the amount of memory available
to the interpreter.

This annex describes typical limits for a conforming PDF application
(readers and writers). These limits fall into two main classes:

- *Architectural limits*. The hardware on which a conforming reader
  executes imposes certain constraints. For example, an integer is
  usually represented in 32 bits, limiting the range of allowed
  integers. In addition, the design of the software imposes other
  constraints, such as a limit to the number of elements in an array or
  string.

- *Memory limits*. The amount of memory available to a conforming reader
  limits the number of memoryconsuming objects that can be held
  simultaneously.

### C.2 Architectural limits

PDF itself has one architectural limit: Because a cross-reference table
(see 7.5.4, \"Cross-Reference Table\") allocates ten digits to represent
byte offsets, the size of a file shall be limited to 10^10^ bytes
(approximately 10 gigabytes). This limit does not apply in a PDF file
that uses a cross-reference stream (see 7.5.8, \"CrossReference
Streams\") instead of a cross reference table.

Table C.1 describes the minimum architectural limits that should be
accommodated by conforming readers running on 32-bit machines. Because
conforming readers may be subject to these limits, conforming writers
producing PDF files should remain within them.

NOTE Memory limits are often exceeded before architectural limits (such
as the limit on the number of indirect objects) are reached.

+--------------+-------------+------------------------------------+

Additionally, conforming writers should adhere to the following
constraints, and conforming readers should accommodate PDF files that
obey the constraints.

- Thumbnail images should be no larger than 106 by 106 samples, and
  should be created at one-eighth scale for 8.5-by-11-inch and A4-size
  pages.

- The minimum page size should be 3 by 3 units in default user space;
  the maximum should be 14,400 by 14,400 units. In versions of PDF
  earlier than 1.6, the size of the default user space unit was fixed at
  1 ⁄ 72 inch, yielding a minimum of approximately 0.04 by 0.04 inch and
  a maximum of 200 by 200 inches. Beginning with PDF 1.6, the size of
  the unit may be set on a page-by-page basis; the default remains at 1/
  72 inch.

- The magnification factor of a view should be constrained to be between
  approximately 8 percent and 6400 percent.

- When a conforming reader reads a PDF file with a damaged or missing
  cross-reference table, it may attempt to rebuild the table by scanning
  all the objects in the file. However, the generation numbers of
  deleted entries are lost if the cross-reference table is missing or
  severely damaged. To facilitate such reconstruction, object
  identifiers, the **endobj** keyword, and the endstream keyword should
  appear at the start of a line. Also, the data within a stream should
  not contain a line beginning with the word **endstream**, aside from
  the required **endstream** that delimits the end of the stream.

### C.3 Memory limits

Memory limits cannot be characterized as precisely as architectural
limits because the amount of available memory and the ways in which it
is allocated vary from one conforming product to another.

NOTE Memory is automatically reallocated from one use to another when
necessary: when more memory is needed for a particular purpose, it can
be taken from memory allocated to another purpose if that memory is
currently unused or its use is nonessential (a cache, for example).
Also, data is often saved to a temporary file when memory is limited.
Because of this behaviour, it is not possible to state limits for such
items as the number of pages in a document, number of text annotations
or hypertext links on a page, number of graphics objects on a page, or
number of fonts on a page or in a document.

**Character Sets and Encodings**

### D.1 General

This annex lists the character sets and encodings that shall be
predefined in any conforming reader. Simple fonts, encompassing Latin
text and some symbols, are described here. See 9.7.5.2, \"Predefined
CMaps\" for a list of predefined CMaps for CID-keyed fonts.

D.2, \"Latin Character Set and Encodings\", describes the entire
character set for the Adobe standard Latin-text fonts. This character
set shall be supported by the Times, Helvetica, and Courier font
families, which are among the standard 14 predefined fonts; see 9.6.2.2,
\"Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts)\". For each named character,
an octal character code is defined for four different encodings:
**StandardEncoding**, **MacRomanEncoding**, **WinAnsiEncoding**, and
**PDFDocEncoding** (see Table D.1). Unencoded characters are indicated
by a dash (---).

D.3, \"PDFDocEncoding Character Set\", describes the entire set of
characters that can be represented using PDFDocEncoding. It presents
these characters in numerical order and it describes the Unicode
representation of each character. This table overlaps the information
presented in D.2, \"Latin Character Set and Encodings\", with respect to
the presented octal character codes.

D.4, \"Expert Set and MacExpertEncoding\", describes the "expert"
character set, which contains additional characters useful for
sophisticated typography, such as small capitals, ligatures, and
fractions. For each named character, an octal character code is given in
**MacExpertEncoding**.

NOTE The built-in encoding in an expert font program may be different
from **MacExpertEncoding**.

D.5, \"Symbol Set and Encoding\", and D.6, \"ZapfDingbats Set and
Encoding\", describe the character sets and built-in encodings for the
Symbol and ZapfDingbats (ITC Zapf Dingbats) font programs, which shall
be among the standard 14 predefined fonts. These fonts have built-in
encodings that are unique to each font. The characters for ZapfDingbats
are ordered by code instead of by name, since the names in that font are
meaningless.

> **Table D.1 -- Latin-text encodings**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  **Encoding**           **Description**
  ---------------------- ----------------------------------------
  **StandardEncoding**   Adobe standard Latin-text encoding. This
                         is the built-in encoding defined in Type
                         1 Latin-text font programs (but
                         generally not in TrueType font
                         programs). Conforming readers shall not
                         have a predefined encoding named
                         **StandardEncoding**. However, it is
                         necessary to describe this encoding,
                         since a font's built-in encoding can be
                         used as the base encoding from which
                         differences may be specified in an
                         encoding dictionary.

  **MacRomanEncoding**   Mac OS standard encoding for Latin text
                         in Western writing systems. Conforming
                         readers shall have a predefined encoding
                         named **MacRomanEncoding** that may be
                         used with both Type 1 and TrueType
                         fonts.

  **WinAnsiEncoding**    Windows Code Page 1252, often called the
                         "Windows ANSI" encoding. This is the
                         standard Windows encoding for Latin text
                         in Western writing systems. Conforming
                         readers shall have a predefined encoding
                         named **WinAnsiEncoding** that may be
                         used with both Type 1 and TrueType
                         fonts.

1.  In PDF 1.3, the euro character was added to the Adobe standard Latin
    character set. It shall be encoded as 200 in **WinAnsiEncoding** and
    240 in **PDFDocEncoding**, assigning codes that were previously
    unused. Apple changed the Mac OS Latin-text encoding for code 333
    from the currency character to the euro character. However, this
    incompatible change has *not* been reflected in PDF's
    **MacRomanEncoding**, which shall continue to map code 333 to
    currency. If the euro character is desired, an encoding dictionary
    may be used to specify this single difference from
    **MacRomanEncoding**.

2.  In PDF 1.3, the existing Zcaron and zcaron characters were added to
    **WinAnsiEncoding** as the previously unused codes 216 and 236.

3.  In **WinAnsiEncoding**, all unused codes greater than 40 map to the
    bullet character. However, only code 225 shall be specifically
    assigned to the bullet character; other codes are subject to future
    reassignment.

4.  The character names guillemotleft and guillemotright are misspelled.
    The correct spelling for this punctuation character is *guillemet*.
    However, the misspelled names are the ones actually used in the
    fonts and encodings containing these characters.

5.  The hyphen character is also encoded as 255 in **WinAnsiEncoding**.
    The meaning of this duplicate code shall be "soft hyphen," but it
    shall be typographically the same as hyphen.

6.  The SPACE character shall also be encoded as 312 in
    **MacRomanEncoding** and as 240 in **WinAnsiEncoding**. This
    duplicate code shall signify a nonbreaking space; it shall be
    typographically the same as (U+003A) SPACE.

**Annex E**

> (normative)

**PDF Name Registry**

##  E.1 General

This annex discusses a registry for developers, controlled by ISO and
currently provided by Adobe on behalf of ISO. The registry contains
private names and formats that may be used by conforming writers.
Developer prefixes shall be used to identify extensions to PDF that use
First Class names (see below) and that are intended for public use. (See
7.12.2, "Developer Extensions Dictionary.) "Developers" means any entity
including individuals, companies, non-profits, standards bodies, open
source groups, etc., who are developing standards or software to use and
extend ISO 32000-1.

Private data may be added to PDF documents that enable conforming
reader's to change behavior based on this data. At the same time, users
have certain expectations when opening a PDF document, no matter which
conforming reader is being used. PDF enforces certain restrictions on
private data in order to meet these expectations.

A conforming writer or conforming reader may define new types of
actions, destinations, annotations, security, and file system handlers.
If a user opens a PDF document using a conforming reader for which the
new type of object is not supported, the conforming reader shall behave
as described in Annex I.

A conforming writer may also add keys to any PDF object that is
implemented as a dictionary, except the file trailer dictionary (see
7.5.5, \"File Trailer\"). In addition, a conforming writer may create
tags that indicate the role of marked-content operators *(PDF 1.2)*, as
described in 14.6, \"Marked Content\".

##  E.2 Name Registry

To avoid conflicts with third-party names and with future versions of
PDF, ISO maintains a registry for certain private names and formats.
Developers shall only add private data that conforms to the registry
rules. The registry includes three classes:

- *First class*[. Names and data formats that are of value to a wide
  range of developers. All names defined
  in](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer) [this ISO 32000
  specification are first-class names. Conforming readers that are
  publicly available shall use first-class names for their private data.
  First-class names and data formats shall be registered with ISO and
  shall be made available for all developers to use. To submit a private
  name and format for consideration
  as](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer) [first-class, see the link
  on registering a private PDF extension, at the following Web
  page:](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer)

> [\<
> http://adobe.com/go/ISO32000Registry\>](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer)
>
> [Data format descriptions shall follow the style of ISO 32000-1 and
> give a complete specification of
> the](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer) [intended function of the
> extended information.](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer)

- *Second class*[. Names that are applicable to a specific developer.
  ISO does not register second-class
  data](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer) [formats.) ISO
  distributes second-class names by registering developer-specific
  4-byte prefixes. Those](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer) [bytes
  followed by a LOW LINE (5Fh) shall be used as the first characters in
  the names of all private data](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer)
  [added by the developer. ISO shall not register the same prefix to two
  different developers, thereby](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer)
  [ensuring that different developers' second-class names shall not
  conflict. It is the responsibility of the developer not to use the
  same name in conflicting ways. To register a developer-specific
  prefix, use the following Web
  page:](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer)

> [\<
> http://adobe.com/go/ISO32000Registry\>](http://adobe.com/go/acrobat_developer)

- *Third class*. Names that may be used only in PDF files that other
  third parties will never see because they can conflict with
  third-class names defined by others. Third-class names shall all begin
  with a specific prefix reserved for private extensions. This prefix,
  which is XX, shall be used as the first characters in the names of all
  private data added by the developer. It is not necessary to contact
  ISO to register third-class names.

New keys for the document information dictionary (see 14.3.3, \"Document
Information Dictionary\") or a thread information dictionary (in the
***I*** entry of a thread dictionary; see Section 12.4.3, "Articles")
shall not be registered.

More information about developer prefixes, handlers and extensions to
ISO 32000-1 can be obtained at http:// www.aiim.org/ISO32000Registry.

**Annex F**

> (normative)

**Linearized PDF**

##  F.1 General

Linearization of PDF is an optional feature available beginning in PDF
1.2 that enables efficient incremental access of the file in a network
environment. A conforming reader that does not support this optional
feature can still successfully process linearized files although not as
efficiently. Enhanced conforming readers can recognize that a PDF file
has been linearized and may take advantage of that organization (as well
as added hint information) to enhance viewing performance.

The primary goal for a linearized PDF file is to achieve the following
behaviour for documents of arbitrary size and so that the total number
of pages in the document should have little or no effect on the
user-perceived performance of viewing any particular page:

- When a document is opened, display the first page as quickly as
  possible. The first page to be viewed may be an arbitrary page of the
  document, not necessarily page 0 (though opening at page 0 is most
  common).

- When the user requests another page of an open document (for example,
  by going to the next page or by following a link to an arbitrary
  page), display that page as quickly as possible.

- When data for a page is delivered over a slow channel, display the
  page incrementally as it arrives. To the extent possible, display the
  most useful data first.

- Permit user interaction, such as following a link, to be performed
  even before the entire page has been received and displayed.

NOTE A linearized PDF is optimized for viewing of read-only PDF
documents. A linearized PDF should be generated once and read many
times.

Incremental update shall still be permitted, but the resulting PDF is no
longer linearized and subsequently shall be treated as ordinary PDF.
Linearizing it again may require reprocessing the entire file; see G.7,
\"Accessing an Updated File\" for details.

Linearized PDF requires two additions to the PDF specification:

- Rules for the ordering of objects in the PDF file

- Additional optional data structures, called *hint tables*, that enable
  efficient navigation within the document

Both of these additions are relatively simple to describe; however,
using them effectively requires a deeper understanding of their purpose.
Consequently, this annex goes considerably beyond a simple specification
of these PDF extensions to include background, motivation, and
strategies.

- F.2, \"Background and Assumptions,\" provides background information
  about the properties of the Web that are relevant to the design of
  Linearized PDF.

- F.3, \"Linearized PDF Document Structure,\" specifies the file format
  and object-ordering requirements of Linearized PDF.

- F.4, \"Hint Tables,\" specifies the detailed representation of the
  hint tables.

- Annex G, outlines strategies for accessing Linearized PDF over a
  network, which in turn determine the optimal way to organize the PDF
  file.

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic architecture of the
Web, including terms such as URL, HTTP, and MIME.

## F.2 Background and Assumptions

+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > The principal problem addressed by the Linearized PDF   |
| 1    | > design is the access of PDF documents through the Web.  |
|      | > This environment has the following important            |
|      | > properties:                                             |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - The access protocol (HTTP) is a transaction consisting  |
|      |   of a request and a response. The conforming reader      |
|      |   presents a request in the form of a URL, and the server |
|      |   sends a response consisting of one or more MIME-tagged  |
|      |   data blocks.                                            |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - After a transaction has completed, obtaining more data  |
|      |   requires a new request-response transaction. The        |
|      |   connection between conforming reader and server does    |
|      |   not ordinarily persist beyond the end of a transaction, |
|      |   although some implementations may attempt to cache the  |
|      |   open connection to expedite subsequent transactions     |
|      |   with the same server.                                   |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - Round-trip delay can be significant. A request-response |
|      |   transaction can take up to several seconds, independent |
|      |   of the amount of data requested.                        |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - The data rate may be limited. A typical bottleneck is a |
|      |   slow link between the conforming reader and the         |
|      |   Internet service provider.                              |
|      |                                                           |
|      | > These properties are generally shared by other          |
|      | > wide-area network architectures besides the Web. Also,  |
|      | > CD-ROMs share some of these properties, since they have |
|      | > relatively slow seek times and limited data rates       |
|      | > compared to magnetic media. The remainder of this annex |
|      | > focuses on the Web.                                     |
|      | >                                                         |
|      | > Some additional properties of the HTTP protocol are     |
|      | > relevant to the problem of accessing PDF files          |
|      | > efficiently. These properties may not all be shared by  |
|      | > other protocols or network environments.                |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - When a PDF file is initially accessed (such as by       |
|      |   following a URL hyperlink from some other document),    |
|      |   the file type is not known to the conforming reader.    |
|      |   Therefore, the conforming reader initiates a            |
|      |   transaction to retrieve the entire document and then    |
|      |   inspects the MIME tag of the response as it arrives.    |
|      |   Only at that point is the document known to be PDF.     |
|      |   Additionally, with a properly configured server         |
|      |   environment, the length of the document becomes known   |
|      |   at that time.                                           |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - The conforming reader may abort a response while the    |
|      |   transaction is still in progress if it decides that the |
|      |   remainder of the data is not of immediate interest. In  |
|      |   HTTP, aborting the transaction requires closing the     |
|      |   connection, which interferes with the strategy of       |
|      |   caching the open connection between transactions.       |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - The conforming reader may request retrieval of portions |
|      |   of a document by specifying one or more byte ranges (by |
|      |   offset and count) in the HTTP request headers. Each     |
|      |   range can be relative to either the beginning or the    |
|      |   end of the file. The conforming reader may specify as   |
|      |   many ranges as it wants in the request, and the         |
|      |   response consists of multiple blocks, each properly     |
|      |   tagged.                                                 |
|      |                                                           |
|      | - The conforming reader may initiate multiple concurrent  |
|      |   transactions in an attempt to obtain multiple responses |
|      |   in parallel. This is commonly done, for instance, to    |
|      |   retrieve inline images referenced from an HTML          |
|      |   document. This strategy is not always reliable and may  |
|      |   backfire if the transactions interfere with each other  |
|      |   by competing for scarce resources in the server or the  |
|      |   communication channel.                                  |
+:=====+===========================================================+
| NOTE | > Extensive experimentation has determined that having    |
| 2    | > multiple concurrent transactions does not work very     |
|      | > well for PDF in some important environments. Therefore, |
|      | > Linearized PDF is designed to enable good performance   |

|      | > byte ranges in a single request.                        |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE | > The following additional assumptions are made about the |
| 3    | > conforming reader and its local environment:            |
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

- The conforming reader has plenty of local temporary storage available.
  It should rarely need to retrieve a given portion of a PDF document
  more than once from the server.

- The conforming reader is able to display PDF data quickly once it has
  been received. The performance bottleneck is assumed to be in the
  transport system (throughput or round-trip delay), not in the
  processing of data after it arrives.

> The consequence of these assumptions is that it may be advantageous
> for the conforming reader to do considerable extra work to minimize
> delays due to communications.

Such work includes maintaining local caches and reordering actions
according to when the needed data becomes available.

##  F.3 Linearized PDF Document Structure

###  F.3.1 General

Except as noted below, all elements of a Linearized PDF file shall be as
specified in 7.5, \"File Structure\", and all indirect objects in the
file shall be shall be divided into two groups.

- The first group shall consist of the document catalogue, other
  document-level objects, and all objects belonging to the first page of
  the document. These objects shall be numbered sequentially, starting
  at the first object number after the last number of the second group.
  (The stream containing the hint tables, called a *hint stream*, may be
  numbered out of sequence; see F.3.6, \"Hint Streams (Parts 5 and
  10)\".

- The second group shall consist of all remaining objects in the
  document, including all pages after the first, all shared objects
  (objects referenced from more than one page, not counting objects
  referenced from the first page), and so forth. These objects shall be
  numbered sequentially starting at 1.

These groups of objects shall be indexed by exactly two cross-reference
table sections. For pedagogical reasons the linearized PDF is considered
to be composed from 11 parts, in order, and the composition of these
groups is discussed in more detail in the sections that follow. All
objects shall have a generation number of 0.

Beginning with PDF 1.5, PDF files may contain object streams (see 7.5.7,
\"Object Streams\"). In linearized files containing object streams, the
following conditions shall apply:

- These additional objects may not be contained in an object stream: the
  linearization dictionary, the document catalogue, and page objects.

- Objects stored within object streams shall be given the highest range
  of object numbers within the main and first-page cross-reference
  sections.

- For files containing object streams, hint data may specify the
  location and size of the object streams only (or uncompressed
  objects), not the individual compressed objects. Similarly, shared
  object references shall be made to the object stream containing a
  compressed object, not to the compressed object itself.

- Cross-reference streams (7.5.8, \"Cross-Reference Streams\") may be
  used in place of traditional crossreference tables. The logic
  described in this sub-clause shall still apply, with the appropriate
  syntactic changes.

###  F.3.2 Header (Part 1)

The Linearized PDF file shall begin with the standard header line (see
7.5.2, \"File Header\"). Linearization is independent of PDF version
number and may be applied to any PDF file of version 1.1 or greater.

The binary characters following the PERCENT SIGN (25h) on the second
line are characters with codes 128 or greater, as recommended in 7.5.2,
\"File Header\".

###  F.3.3 Linearization Parameter Dictionary (Part 2)

Following the header, the first object in the body of the file (part 2)
shall be an indirect dictionary object, the *linearization parameter
dictionary*, which shall contain the parameters listed in Table F.1. All
values in this dictionary shall be direct objects. There shall be no
references to this dictionary anywhere in the document; however, the
first-page cross-reference table (part 3) shall contain a normal entry
for it.

The linearization parameter dictionary shall be entirely contained
within the first 1024 bytes of the PDF file. This limits the amount of
data a conforming reader must read before deciding whether the file is
linearized.

> **Table F.1 -- Entries in the linearization parameter dictionary**

+----------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| **Parameter**  | **Type** | **Value**                             |
+:===============+:=========+:======================================+
| **Linearized** | number   | *(Required)* A version identification |
|                |          | for the linearized format.            |
+----------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| **L**          | integer  | *(Required)* The length of the entire |
|                |          | file in bytes. It shall be exactly    |
|                |          | equal to the actual length of the PDF |
|                |          | file. A mismatch indicates that the   |
|                |          | file is not linearized and shall be   |
|                |          | treated as ordinary PDF, ignoring     |
|                |          | linearization information. (If the    |
|                |          | mismatch resulted from appending an   |
|                |          | update, the linearization information |
|                |          | may still be correct but requires     |
|                |          | validation; see G.7, \"Accessing an   |

|                |          | \] or \[ *offset*~1~ *length*~1~      |
|                |          | *offset*~2~ *length*~2~ \].           |
|                |          | *offset*~1~ shall be the offset of    |
|                |          | the primary hint stream from the      |
|                |          | beginning of the file. (This is the   |
|                |          | beginning of the stream object, not   |
|                |          | the beginning of the stream data.)    |
|                |          | *length*~1~ shall be the length of    |
|                |          | this stream, including stream object  |
|                |          | overhead.                             |

|                |          | If the value of the primary hint      |
|                |          | stream dictionary's **Length** entry  |
|                |          | is an indirect reference, the object  |

|                |          | also shall include the length of the  |

|                |          | If there is an overflow hint stream,  |
|                |          | *offset*~2~ and *length*~2~ shall     |
|                |          | specify its offset and length.        |
+----------------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| **O**          | integer  | *(Required)* The object number of the |

+----------------+----------+---------------------------------------+

### F.3.4 First-Page Cross-Reference Table and Trailer (Part 3)

Part 3 shall contain the cross-reference table for objects belonging to
the first page (discussed in F.3.4, \"FirstPage Cross-Reference Table
and Trailer (Part 3)\") as well as for the document catalogue and
document-level objects appearing before the first page (discussed in
F.3.5, \"Document Catalogue and Document-Level Objects (Part 4)\").
Additionally, this cross-reference table shall contain entries for the
linearization parameter dictionary (at the beginning) and the primary
hint stream (at the end). This table shall be a valid cross-reference
table as defined in 7.5.4, \"Cross-Reference Table\", although its
position in the file shall not be at the end of the file. It shall
consist of a single cross-reference subsection that has no free entries.

In PDF 1.5 and later, cross-reference streams (see 7.5.8,
\"Cross-Reference Streams\") may be used in linearized files in place of
traditional cross-reference tables. The logic described in this section,
along with the appropriate syntactic changes for cross-reference streams
shall still apply.

Below the table shall be the first-page trailer. The trailer's **Prev**
entry shall give the offset of the main crossreference table near the
end of the file. A conforming reader that does not support the
linearized feature shall process this correctly even though the trailers
are linked in an unusual order. It interprets the first-page
crossreference table as an update to an original document that is
indexed by the main cross-reference table.

The first-page trailer shall contain valid **Size** and **Root**
entries, as well as any other entries needed to display the document.
The **Size** value shall be the combined number of entries in both the
first-page cross-reference table and the main cross-reference table.

The first-page trailer may optionally end with **startxref**, an
integer, and %%EOF, just as in an ordinary trailer. This information
shall be ignored.

###  F.3.5 Document Catalogue and Document-Level Objects (Part 4)

Following the first-page cross-reference table and trailer are the
catalogue dictionary and other objects that are required present when
the document is opened. These additional objects (constituting part 4)
shall include the values of the following entries if they are present
and are indirect objects:

- The conforming reader **Preferences** entry in the catalogue.

- The **PageMode** entry in the catalogue. Note that if the value of
  **PageMode** is UseOutlines, the outline hierarchy shall be located in
  part 6; otherwise, the outline hierarchy, if any, shall be located in
  part 9. See F.3.10, \"Other Objects (Part 9)\" for details.

- The **Threads** entry in the catalogue, along with all thread
  dictionaries it refers to. This does not include the threads'
  information dictionaries or the individual bead dictionaries belonging
  to the threads.

- The **OpenAction** entry in the catalogue.

- The **AcroForm** entry in the catalogue. Only the top-level
  interactive form dictionary shall be present, not the objects that it
  refers to.

- The **Encrypt** entry in the first-page trailer dictionary. All values
  in the encryption dictionary shall also be located here.

All other objects shall not be located here but instead shall be at the
end of the file; see F.3.10, \"Other Objects (Part 9)\". This includes
objects such as page tree nodes, the document information dictionary,
and the definitions for named destinations.

NOTE The objects located here are indexed by the first-page
cross-reference table, even though they are not logically part of the
first page.

###  F.3.6 Hint Streams (Parts 5 and 10)

The core of the linearization information shall be stored in data
structures known as *hint tables*, whose format is described in F.4,
\"Hint Tables.\" They shall provide indexing information that enables
the conforming reader to construct a single request for all the objects
that are needed to display any page of the document or to retrieve other
information efficiently. The hint tables may contain additional
information to optimize access by conforming writer extensions to
application-specific data.

The hint tables shall not be logically part of the information content
of the document; they shall be derived from the document. Any action
that changes the document---for instance, appending an incremental
update---invalidates the hint tables. The document remains a valid PDF
file but is no longer linearized; see G.7, \"Accessing an Updated File\"
for details.

The hint tables are binary data structures that shall be enclosed in a
stream object. Syntactically, this stream shall be a PDF indirect
object. However, there shall be no references to the stream anywhere in
the document.

Therefore, it is not logically part of the document, and an operation
that regenerates the document may remove the stream.

Usually, all the hint tables shall be contained in a single stream,
known as the *primary hint stream*. Optionally, there may be an
additional stream containing more hints, known as the *overflow hint
stream*. The contents of the two hint streams shall be concatenated and
treated as if they were a single unbroken stream.

The primary hint stream, which shall be required, is shown as part 5 in
Example 5. The order of this part and the first-page section, shown as
part 6, may be reversed; see Annex G for considerations on the choice of
placement. The overflow hint stream, part 10, is optional.

The location and length of the primary hint stream, and of the overflow
hint stream if present, shall be given in the linearization parameter
dictionary at the beginning of the file.

The hint streams shall be assigned the last object numbers in the
file---that is, after the object number for the last object in the first
page. Their cross-reference table entries shall be at the end of the
first-page crossreference table. This object number assignment shall be
independent of the physical locations of the hint streams in the file.

NOTE This convention keeps their object numbers from conflicting with
the numbering of the linearized objects.

With one exception, the values of all entries in the hint streams'
dictionaries shall be direct objects and may contain no indirect object
references. The exception is the stream dictionary's **Length** entry
(see the discussion of the **H** entry in Table F.1).

In addition to the standard stream attributes, the dictionary of the
primary hint stream shall contain entries giving the position of the
beginning of each hint table in the stream. These positions shall be
counted in bytes relative to the beginning of the stream data (after
decoding filters, if any, are applied) and with the overflow hint stream
concatenated if present. The dictionary of the overflow hint stream
shall not contain these entries. The keys designating the standard hint
tables in the primary hint stream's dictionary are listed in Table F.2;
F.4, \"Hint Tables,\" documents the format of these hint tables.
Additionally, there is a required page offset hint table, which shall be
the first table in the stream and shall start at offset 0.

New keys may be registered for additional hint tables required

Annex E for further information.

###  F.3.7 First-Page Section (Part 6)

This part of the file contains all the objects needed to display the
first page of the document. Ordinarily, the first page is page 0---that
is, the leftmost leaf page node in the page tree. However, if the
document catalogue contains an **OpenAction** entry that specifies
opening at some page other than page 0, that page shall be considered
the first page and shall be located here. The page number of the first
page is given in the **P** entry of the linearization parameter
dictionary.

NOTE As mentioned earlier, the section containing objects belonging to
the first page of the document may either precede or follow the primary
hint stream. The starting file offset and length of this section can be
determined from the hint tables. In addition, the **E** entry in the
linearization parameter dictionary specifies the end of the first page
(as an offset relative to the beginning of the file), and the **O**
entry gives the object number of the first page's page object.

The following objects shall be contained in the first-page section:

- The page object for the first page. This object shall be the first one
  in this part of the file. Its object number is given in the
  linearization parameter dictionary. This page object shall explicitly
  specify all required attributes, such as **Resources** and
  **MediaBox**; the attributes may not be inherited from ancestor page
  tree nodes.

- The entire outline hierarchy, if the value of the **PageMode** entry
  in the catalogue is UseOutlines. If the **PageMode** entry is omitted
  or has some other value and the document has an outline hierarchy, the
  outline hierarchy shall appear in part 9; see F.3.10, \"Other Objects
  (Part 9)\" for details.

- All objects that the page object refers to, to an arbitrary depth,
  except page tree nodes or other page objects. This shall include
  objects referred to by its **Contents**, **Resources**, **Annots**,
  and **B** entries, but not the **Thumb** entry.

The order of objects referenced from the page object should facilitate
early user interaction and incremental display of the page data as it
arrives. The following order should be used:

a)  The **Annots** array and all annotation dictionaries, to a depth
    sufficient for those annotations to be activated. Information
    required to draw the annotation may be deferred until later since
    annotations are always drawn on top of (hence after) the contents.

b)  The **B** (beads) array and all bead dictionaries, if any, for this
    page. If any beads exist for this page, the **B** array shall be
    present in the page dictionary. Additionally, each bead in the
    thread (not just the first bead) shall contain a **T** entry
    referring to the associated thread dictionary.

c)  The resource dictionary, but not the resource objects contained in
    the dictionary.

d)  Resource objects, other than the types listed below, in the order
    that they are first referenced (directly or indirectly) from the
    content stream. If the contents are represented as an array of
    streams, each resource object shall precede the stream in which it
    is first referenced. Note that **Font**, **FontDescriptor**, and
    **Encoding** resources shall be included here, but not substitutable
    font files referenced from font descriptors (see item (g) below).

e)  The page contents (**Contents**). If large, this should be
    represented as an array of indirect references to content streams,
    which in turn shall be interleaved with the resources they require.
    If small, the entire contents should be a single content stream
    preceding the resources.

f)  Image XObjects, in the order that they are first referenced. Images
    can be assumed to be large and slow to transfer; therefore, the
    conforming reader should defer rendering images until all the other
    contents have been displayed.

g)  **FontFile** streams, which contain the actual definitions of
    embedded fonts. These can be assumed to be large and slow to
    transfer; therefore, the conforming reader should use substitute
    fonts until the real ones have arrived. Only those fonts for which
    substitution is possible may be deferred in this way. (Currently,
    this includes any Type 1 or TrueType font that has a font descriptor
    with the Nonsymbolic flag set, indicating the Adobe standard Latin
    character set).

See Annex G for additional discussion about object order and incremental
drawing strategies.

### F.3.8 Remaining Pages (Part 7)

Part 7 of the Linearized PDF file shall contain the page objects and
nonshared objects for all remaining pages of the file, with the objects
for each page grouped together. The pages shall be contiguous and shall
be ordered by page number. If the first page of the file is not page 0,
this section shall start with page 0 and shall skip over the first page
when its position in the sequence is reached.

For each page, the objects required to display that page shall be
grouped together, except for resources and other objects that are shared
with other pages. Shared objects shall be located in the shared objects
section (part 8). The starting file offset and length of any page can be
determined from the hint tables.

The recommended order of objects within a page is essentially the same
as in the first page. In particular, the page object shall be the first
object in each section.

In most cases, unlike for the first page, little benefit is gained from
interleaving contents with resources because most resources other than
images---fonts in particular---are shared among multiple pages and
therefore reside in the shared objects section. Image XObjects usually
are not shared, but they should appear at the end of the page's section
of the file, since rendering of images is deferred.

### F.3.9 Shared Objects (Part 8)

Part 8 of the file contains objects, primarily named resources, that are
referenced from more than one page but that are not referenced (directly
or indirectly) from the first page. The hint tables contain an index of
these objects. For more information on named resources, see 7.8.3,
\"Resource Dictionaries\".

The order of these objects shall be arbitrary. However, wherever a
resource consists of a multiple-level structure, all components of the
structure shall be grouped together. If only the top-level object is
referenced from outside the group, the entire group may be described by
a single entry in the shared object hint table. This helps to minimize
the size of the shared object hint table and the number of individual
references from entries in the page offset hint table.

### F.3.10 Other Objects (Part 9)

Following the shared objects are any other objects that are part of the
document but are not required for displaying pages. These objects shall
be divided into functional categories. Objects within each of these
categories should be grouped together; the relative order of the
categories is unimportant.

- *The page tree*. This object can be located in this section because
  the conforming reader never needs to consult it. Note that all
  **Resources** attributes and other inheritable attributes of the page
  objects shall be pushed down and replicated in each of the leaf page
  objects (but they may contain indirect references to shared objects).

- *Thumbnail images*. These objects shall simply be ordered by page
  number. (The thumbnail image for page 0 shall be first, even if the
  first page of the document is some page other than 0.) Each thumbnail
  image consists of one or more objects, which may refer to objects in
  the thumbnail shared objects section (see the next item).

- *Thumbnail shared objects*. These are objects that shall be shared
  among some or all thumbnail images and shall not be referenced from
  any other objects.

- *The outline hierarchy*, if not located in part 6. The order of
  objects shall be the same as the order in which they shall be
  displayed by the conforming reader. This is a preorder traversal of
  the outline tree, skipping over any subtree that is closed (that is,
  whose parent's **Count** value is negative). Following that shall be
  the subtrees that were skipped over, in the order in which they would
  have appeared if they were all open.

- *Thread information dictionaries*, referenced from the **I** entries
  of thread dictionaries. Note that the thread dictionaries themselves
  shall be located with the document catalogue and the bead dictionaries
  with the individual pages.

- *Named destinations*. These objects include the value of the **Dests**
  or **Names** entry in the document catalogue and all the destination
  objects that it refers to; see G.3, \"Opening at an Arbitrary Page\".

- *The document information dictionary* and the objects contained within
  it.

- *The interactive form field hierarchy*. This group of objects shall
  not include the top-level interactive form dictionary, which is
  located with the document catalogue.

- *Other entries* in the document catalogue that are not referenced from
  any page.

- *(PDF 1.3) The logical structure hierarchy*.

- *(PDF 1.5) The renditions name tree hierarchy.*

- *(PDF 1.5) Embedded file streams.*

###  F.3.11 Main Cross-Reference and Trailer (Part 11)

Part 11 is the cross-reference table for all objects in the PDF file
except those listed in the first-page crossreference table (part 3). As
indicated earlier, this cross-reference table shall play the role of the
original crossreference table for the file (before any updates are
appended) and shall conform to the following rules:

- It consists of a single cross-reference subsection, beginning at
  object number 0.

- The first entry (for object number 0) shall be a free entry.

- The remaining entries are for in-use objects, which shall be numbered
  consecutively, starting at 1.

The **startxref** line shall give the offset of the first-page
cross-reference table. The **Prev** entry of the first-page trailer
shall give the offset of the main cross-reference table. The main
trailer has no **Prev** entry and shall not contain any entries other
than **Size**.

In PDF 1.5 and later, cross-reference streams (see 7.5.8,
\"Cross-Reference Streams\") may be used in linearized files in place of
traditional cross-reference tables. The logic described in this
sub-clause, along with the appropriate syntactic changes for
cross-reference streams, still applies.

## F.4 Hint Tables

The core of the linearization information shall be stored in two or more
hint tables, as indicated by the attributes of the primary hint stream;
see F.3.6, \"Hint Streams (Parts 5 and 10)\". The format of the standard
hint tables is described in this section.

A conforming writer may add additional hint tables for conforming
reader-specific data. A generic format for such hint tables is defined;
see F.4.4, \"Generic Hint Tables.\" Alternatively, the format of a hint
table can be private to the conforming reader; see Annex E for further
information.

Each hint table shall consist of a portion of the stream, beginning at
the position in the stream indicated by the corresponding stream
attribute. Additionally, a conforming writer shall include a page offset
hint table, which shall be the first table in the stream and shall start
at offset 0. If there is an overflow hint stream, its contents shall be
appended seamlessly to the primary hint stream.

NOTE 1 Hint table positions are relative to the beginning of this
combined stream.

In general, this byte stream shall be treated as a bit stream,
high-order bit first, which shall then subdivided into fields of
arbitrary width without regard to byte boundaries. However, each hint
table shall begin at a byte boundary.

NOTE 2 The hint tables are designed to encode the required information
as compactly as possible. Interpreting the hint tables requires reading
them sequentially; they are not designed for random access.

The conforming reader shall be expected to read and decode the tables
once and retain the information for as long as the document remains
open.

NOTE 3 A hint table encodes the positions of various objects in the
file. The representation is either explicit (an offset from the
beginning of the file) or implicit (accumulated lengths of preceding
objects).

Regardless of the representation, the resulting positions shall be
interpreted as if the primary hint stream itself were not present. That
is, a position greater than the *hint stream offset* shall have the
*hint stream length* added to it to determine the actual offset relative
to the beginning of the file.

NOTE 4 The hint stream offset and hint stream length are the values
offset1 and length1 in the **H** array in the linearization parameter
dictionary at the beginning of the file.

> The reason for this rule is that the length of the primary hint stream
> depends on the information contained within the hint tables, which is
> not known until after they have been generated. Any information
> contained in the hint tables shall not depend on knowing the primary
> hint stream's length in advance.
>
> Note that this rule applies only to offsets given in the hint tables
> and not to offsets given in the cross-reference tables or
> linearization parameter dictionary. Also, the offset and length of the
> overflow hint stream, if present, does not be taken into account,
> since this object follows all other objects in the file.
>
> In linearized files that use object streams (7.5.7, \"Object
> Streams\"), the position specified in a hint table for a compressed
> object is to be interpreted as a byte range in which the object can be
> found, not as a precise offset. conforming readers should locate the
> object via a cross-reference stream, as it would if the hint table
> were not present.

### F.4.1 Page Offset Hint Table

The page offset hint table provides information required for locating
each page. Additionally, for each page except the first, it also
enumerates all shared objects that the page references, directly or
indirectly.

This table shall begin with a header section, described in Table F.3,
followed by one or more per-page entries, described in Table F.4.

NOTE The items making up each per-page entry are not contiguous; they
are broken up with items from entries for other pages.

The order of items making up the per-page entries shall be as follows:

a)  Item 1 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

b)  Item 2 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

c)  Item 3 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

d)  Item 4 for all shared objects in the second page, followed by item 4
    for all shared objects in the third page, and so on

e)  Item 5 for all shared objects in the second page, followed by item 5
    for all shared objects in the third page, and so on

f)  Item 6 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

g)  Item 7 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

All the items in Table F.3 that specify a number of bits needed, such as
item 3, have values in the range 0 through 32. Although that range
requires only 6 bits, 16-bit numbers shall be used.

###  F.4.2 Shared Object Hint Table

The shared object hint table gives information required to locate shared
objects; see F.3.9, \"Shared Objects (Part 8)\". Shared objects may be
physically located in either of two places: objects that are referenced
from the first page shall be located with the first-page objects (part
6); all other shared objects shall be located in the shared objects
section (part 8).

A single entry in the shared object hint table may describe a group of
adjacent objects under the following condition: Only the first object in
the group is referenced from outside the group; the remaining objects in
the group are referenced only from other objects in the same group. The
objects in a group shall have adjacent object numbers.

The page offset hint table, interactive form hint table, and logical
structure hint table shall refer to an entry in the shared object hint
table by a simple index that is its sequential position in the table,
counting from 0.

The shared object hint table shall consist of a header section (Table
F.5) followed by one or more shared object group entries (Table F.6).
There shall be two sequences of shared object group entries: the ones
for objects located in the first page, followed by the ones for objects
located in the shared objects section. The entries shall have the same
format in both cases. Note that the items making up each shared object
group entry need not be contiguous; they may be broken up with items
from entries for other shared object groups. The order of items in each
sequence shall be as follows:

a)  Item 1 for the first group, item 1 for the second group, and so on

b)  Item 2 for the first group, item 2 for the second group, and so on

c)  Item 3 for the first group, item 3 for the second group, and so on

d)  Item 4 for the first group, item 4 for the second group, and so on

All objects associated with the first page (part 6) shall have entries
in the shared object hint table, regardless of whether they are actually
shared. The first entry shall refer to the beginning of the first page
and shall be have an object count and length that shall span all the
initial nonshared objects. The next entry shall refer to a group of
shared objects. Subsequent entries shall span additional groups of
either shared or nonshared objects consecutively until all shared
objects in the first page have been enumerated. (There shall not be any
entries that refer to nonshared objects.)

                        the first page (including nonshared
                        objects, as noted above).

                        the number of shared object entries for
                        the first page (that is, the value of
                        item 3).

table reflects this.

###  F.4.3 Thumbnail Hint Table

The thumbnail hint table shall consist of a header section (Table F.7)
followed by the thumbnails section, which shall include one or more
per-page entries (Table F.8), each of which describes the thumbnail
image for a single page. The entries shall be in page number order
starting with page 0, even if the document catalogue contains an
**OpenAction** entry that specifies opening at some page other than page
0. Thumbnail images may exist for some pages and not for others.

                        in the thumbnail shared objects section
                        (a subsection of part 9). This section
                        includes objects (colour spaces, for
                        example) that shall be referenced from
                        some or all thumbnail objects and are
                        not referenced from any other objects.
                        The thumbnail shared objects shall be
                        undifferentiated; there is no

                           a thumbnail image lie between the
                           previous entry's page and this page.

             F.7, item 8   number of objects in a thumbnail image
                           (Table F.7, item 7), gives the number
                           of objects in this page's thumbnail
                           image.

                           item 5), gives the length of this
                           page's thumbnail image in bytes.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

The order of items in Table F.8 is as follows:

a)  Item 1 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

b)  Item 2 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

c)  Item 3 for all pages, in page order starting with the first page

### F.4.4 Generic Hint Tables

Categories of objects are associated with the document as a whole rather
than with individual pages (see F.3.10, \"Other Objects (Part 9)\"), and
hints should be provided for accessing those objects efficiently. For
each category of hints, there shall be a separate entry in the primary
hint stream giving the starting position of the table within the stream;
see F.3.6, \"Hint Streams (Parts 5 and 10)\".

Such hints shall be represented by a generic hint table, which describes
a single group of objects that are located together in the PDF file. The
entries in this table are listed in Table F.9. This representation shall
be used for the following hint tables, if needed:

- Outline hint table

- Thread information hint table

- Named destination hint table

- Information dictionary hint table

- Page label hint table

Generic hint tables may be used for product-specific objects accessed by
conforming readers.

NOTE It is considerably more convenient for a conforming reader to use
the generic hint representation than to specify custom hints.

  4          32         The length of the object group in
                        bytes.
  -------------------------------------------------------------

###  F.4.5 Extended Generic Hint Tables

An extended generic hint table shall begin with the same entries as in a
generic hint table, and shall be followed by three additional entries,
as shown in Table F.10. This table provides hints for accessing objects
that reference shared objects. As of PDF 1.5, the following hint tables,
if needed, shall use the extended generic format:

- Interactive form hint table

- Logical structure hint table

- Renditions name tree hint table

Embedded file streams shall not be referred to by this hint table, even
if they are reachable from nodes in the renditions name tree; instead
they shall use the hint table described in F.4.6, \"Embedded File Stream
Hint Tables.\"

                             the numerically greatest shared object
                             identifier used by the objects in the
                             group.

  7 ...      See Table F.3,  Starting with item 7, each of the
             item 11         remaining items in this table shall be
                             a shared object identifier---that is,
                             an index into the shared object hint
                             table (described in F.4.2, "Shared
                             Object Hint Table").
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

###  F.4.6 Embedded File Stream Hint Tables

The embedded file streams hint table allows a conforming reader to
locate all byte ranges of a PDF file needed to access its embedded file
streams. An embedded file stream may be grouped with other objects that
it references; all objects in such a group shall have adjacent object
numbers. (A group shall contain no objects at all if it contains shared
object references.)

This hint table shall have a header section (see Table F.11), which
shall have general information about the embedded file stream groups.
The header section shall be followed by the entries in Table F.12. Each
of the items in Table F.12 shall be repeated for each embedded file
stream group (the number of groups being represented by item 3 in Table
F.11). That is, the order of items in Table F.12 shall be item 1 for the
first group, item 1 for the second group, and so on; item 2 for the
first group, item 2 for the second group, and so on; repeated for the 5
items.

**Linearized PDF Access Strategies**

##  G.1 General

This section outlines how the conforming reader can take advantage of
the structure of a Linearized PDF file to retrieve and display it
efficiently. This material may help explain the rationale for the
organization.

##  G.2 Opening at the First Page

As described earlier, when a document is initially accessed, a request
is issued to retrieve the entire file, starting at the beginning.
Consequently, Linearized PDF is organized so that all the data required
to display the first page is at the beginning of the file. This includes
all resources that are referenced from the first page, regardless of
whether they are also referenced from other pages.

The first page is usually but not necessarily page 0. If the document
catalogue contains an **OpenAction** entry that specifies opening at
some page other than page 0, that page is the one physically located at
the beginning of the document. Thus, opening a document at the default
place (rather than a specific destination) requires simply waiting for
the first-page data to arrive; no additional transactions are required.

In an ordinary conforming reader, opening a document requires first
positioning to the end to obtain the **startxref** line. Since a
Linearized PDF file has the first page's cross-reference table at the
beginning, reading the **startxref** line is not necessary. All that is
required is to verify that the file length given in the linearization
parameter dictionary at the beginning of the file matches the actual
length of the file, indicating that no updates have been appended to the
PDF file.

The primary hint stream is located either before or after the first-page
section, which means that it is also retrieved as part of the initial
sequential read of the file. The conforming reader is expected to
interpret and retain all the information in the hint tables. The tables
are reasonably compact and are not designed to be obtained from the file
in random pieces.

The conforming reader must now decide whether to continue reading the
remainder of the document sequentially or to abort the initial
transaction and access subsequent pages by using separate transactions
requesting byte ranges. This decision is a function of the size of the
file, the data rate of the channel, and the overhead cost of a
transaction.

##  G.3 Opening at an Arbitrary Page

The conforming reader may be requested to open a PDF file at an
arbitrary page. The page can be specified in one of three ways:

- By page number (remote go-to action, integer page specifier)

- By named destination (remote go-to action, name or string page
  specifier)

- By article thread (thread action)

Additionally, an indexed search results in opening a document by page
number. Handling this case efficiently is especially important.

As indicated above, when the document is initially opened, it is
retrieved sequentially starting at the beginning. As soon as the hint
tables have been received, the conforming reader has sufficient
information to request retrieval of any page of the document given its
page number. Therefore, the conforming reader can abort the initial
transaction and issue a new transaction for the target page, as
described in G.4, \"Going to Another Page of an Open Document\".

The position of the primary hint stream (part 5 in F.3.1, \"General\")
with respect to the first-page section (part 6 in F.3.1, \"General\")
determines how quickly this can be done. If the primary hint stream
precedes the first-page section, the initial transaction can be aborted
very quickly; however, this is at the cost of increased delay when
opening the document at the first page. On the other hand, if the
primary hint stream follows the first-page section, displaying the first
page is quicker (since the hint tables are not needed for that), but
opening at an arbitrary page is delayed by the time required to receive
the first page. The decision whether to favour opening at the first page
or opening at an arbitrary page must be made at the time a PDF file is
linearized.

If an overflow hint stream exists, obtaining it requires issuing an
additional transaction. For this reason, inclusion of an overflow hint
stream in Linearized PDF, although permitted, is not recommended. The
feature exists to allow the linearizer to write the PDF file with space
reserved for a primary hint stream of an estimated size and then go back
and fill in the hint tables. If the estimate is too small, the
linearizer can append an overflow stream containing the remaining hint
table data. Thus, the PDF file can be written in one pass, which may be
an advantage if the performance of writing PDF is considered important.

Opening at a named destination requires the conforming reader first to
read the entire **Dests** or **Names** dictionary, for which a hint is
present. Using this information, it is possible to determine the page
containing the specific destination identified by the name.

Opening to an article requires the conforming reader first to read the
entire **Threads** array, which is located with the document catalogue
at the beginning of the document. Using this information, it is possible
to determine the page containing the first bead of any thread. Opening
at other than the first bead of a thread requires chaining through all
the beads until the desired one is reached; there are no hints to
accelerate this.

## G.4 Going to Another Page of an Open Document

Given a page number and the information in the hint tables, it is now
straightforward for the conforming reader to construct a single request
to retrieve any arbitrary page of the document. The request should
include the following items:

- The objects of the page itself, whose byte range can be determined
  from the entry in the page offset hint table.

- The portion of the main cross-reference table referring to those
  objects. This can be computed from main cross-reference table location
  (the **T** entry in the linearization parameter dictionary) and the
  cumulative object number in the page offset hint table.

- The shared objects referenced from the page, whose byte ranges can be
  determined from information in the shared object hint table.

- The portion or portions of the main cross-reference table referring to
  those objects, as described above.

The purpose of the fractions in the page offset hint table is to enable
the conforming reader to schedule retrieval of the page in a way that
allows incremental display of the data as it arrives. It accomplishes
this by constructing a request that interleaves pieces of the page
contents with the shared resources that the contents refer to. This
serves much the same purpose as the physical interleaving that is done
for the first page.

##  G.5 Drawing a Page Incrementally

The ordering of objects in pages and the organization of the hint tables
are intended to allow progressive update of the display and early
opportunities for user interaction when the data is arriving slowly. The
conforming reader must recognize instances in which the targets of
indirect object references have not yet arrived and, where possible,
rearrange the order in which it acts on the objects in the page.

The following sequence of actions is recommended:

a)  Activate the annotations, but do not draw them yet. Also activate
    the cursor feedback for any article threads in the page.

b)  Begin drawing the contents. Whenever there is a reference to an
    image XObject that has not yet arrived, skip over it. Whenever there
    is a reference to a font whose definition is an embedded font file
    that has not yet arrived, draw the text using a substitute font (if
    that is possible).

c)  Draw the annotations.

d)  Draw the images as they arrive, together with anything that overlaps
    them.

e)  Once the embedded font definitions have arrived, redraw the text
    using the correct fonts, together with anything that overlaps the
    text.

The last two steps should be done using an off-screen buffer, if
possible, to avoid objectionable flashing during the redraw process.

On encountering a reference XObject (see 8.10.4, \"Reference
XObjects\"), the conforming reader may choose to initially display the
object as a proxy and defer the retrieval and rendering of the imported
content. Note that, since all XObjects in a Linearized PDF file follow
the content stream of the page on which they appear, their retrieval is
already deferred; the use of a reference XObject results in an
additional level of deferral.

##  G.6 Following an Article Thread

As indicated earlier, the bead dictionaries for any article thread that
visits a given page are located with that page. This enables the bead
rectangles to be activated and proper cursor feedback to be shown.

If the user follows a thread, the conforming reader can obtain the
object number from the **N** or **P** entry of the bead dictionary. This
identifies a target bead, which is located with the page to which it
belongs. Given this object number, the conforming reader can go to that
page, as discussed in G.4, \"Going to Another Page of an Open
Document.\"

##  G.7 Accessing an Updated File

As stated earlier, if a Linearized PDF file subsequently has an
incremental update appended to it, the linearization and hints are no
longer valid. Actually, this is not necessarily true, but the conforming
reader must do some additional work to validate the information.

When the conforming reader sees that the file is longer than the length
given in the linearization parameter dictionary, it must issue an
additional transaction to read everything that was appended. It must
then analyse the objects in that update to see whether any of them
modify objects that are in the first page or that are the targets of
hints. If so, it must augment its internal data structures as necessary
to take the updates into account.

For a PDF file that has received only a small update, this approach may
be worthwhile. Accessing the file this way is quicker than accessing it
without hints or retrieving the entire file before displaying any of it.

**Example PDF Files**

## H.1 General

This annex presents several examples showing the structure of actual PDF
files:

- A minimal file that can serve as a starting point for creating other
  PDF files (and that is the basis of later examples)

- A simple example that shows a text string---the classic "Hello
  World"---and a simple graphics example that draws lines and shapes

- A fragment of a PDF file that illustrates the structure of the page
  tree for a large document and, similarly, two fragments that
  illustrate the structure of an outline hierarchy

- An example showing the structure of a PDF file as it is updated
  several times, illustrating multiple body sections, cross-reference
  sections, and trailers

NOTE The ***Length*** values of stream objects in the examples and the
byte addresses in cross-reference tables are not necessarily accurate.

## H.2 Minimal PDF File

The example in H.2, \"Minimal PDF File\" is a PDF file that does not
draw anything; it is almost the minimum acceptable PDF file. It is not
strictly the minimum acceptable because it contains an outline
dictionary (**Outlines** in the document catalog) with a zero count (in
which case this object would normally be omitted); a page content stream
(**Contents** in the page object); and a resource dictionary
(**Resources** in the page object) containing a **ProcSet** array. These
objects were included to make this file useful as a starting point for
creating other, more realistic PDF files.

Table H.1 lists the objects in this example.

> **Table H.1 -- Objects in minimal example**

  5             Content stream

  6             Procedure set array
  ----------------------------------------------

NOTE When using the example in H.2, \"Minimal PDF File\" as a starting
point for creating other files, remember to update the ***ProcSet***
array as needed (see 14.2, \"Procedure Sets\"). Also, remember that the
cross-reference table entries may need to have a trailing SPACE (see
7.5.4, \"Cross-Reference Table\").

## H.3 Simple Text String Example

The example in H.3, \"Simple Text String Example\" is the classic "Hello
World" example built from the preceding example. It shows a single line
of text consisting of the string *Hello World*, illustrating the use of
fonts and several text-related PDF operators. The string is displayed in
24-point Helvetica. Because Helvetica is one of the standard 14 fonts,
no font descriptor is needed.

Table H.2 lists the objects in this example.

## H.6 Outline Hierarchy Example

This section from a PDF file illustrates the structure of an outline
hierarchy with six items. Example 1 in H.6, \"Outline Hierarchy
Example\" shows the outline with all items open, as illustrated in
Figure H.3.

## H.7 Updating Example

This example shows the structure of a PDF file as it is updated several
times; it illustrates multiple body sections, cross-reference sections,
and trailers. In addition, it shows that once an object has been
assigned an object identifier, it keeps that identifier until the object
is deleted, even if the object is altered. Finally, the example
illustrates the reuse of cross-reference entries for objects that have
been deleted, along with the incrementing of the generation number after
an object has been deleted.

The original file is the example in H.2, \"Minimal PDF File\". The
updates are divided into four stages, with the file saved after each
stage:

a)  Four text annotations are added.

b)  The text of one of the annotations is altered.

c)  Two of the text annotations are deleted.

d)  Three text annotations are added.

The following sections show the segments added to the file at each
stage. Throughout this example, objects are referred to by their object
identifiers, which are made up of the object number and the generation
number, rather than simply by their object numbers as in earlier
examples. This is necessary because the example reuses object numbers;
therefore, the objects they denote are not unique.

NOTE The tables in these sections show only those objects that are
modified during the updating process. Objects from H.2, \"Minimal PDF
File\" that are not altered during the update are not shown.

###  H.7.1 Stage 1: Add Four Text Annotations

Four text annotations are added to the initial file and the file is
saved. Table H.4 lists the objects involved in this update.

> **Table H.4 -- Object usage after adding four text annotations**

  -----------------------------------------------
  **Object       **Object type**
  identifier**   
  -------------- --------------------------------
  4 0            **Page** (page object)

  7 0            Annotation array

  8 0            **Annot** (annotation
                 dictionary)

  9 0            **Annot** (annotation
                 dictionary)

  10 0           **Annot** (annotation
                 dictionary)

  11 0           **Annot** (annotation
                 dictionary)
  -----------------------------------------------

The example in H.7.1, \"Stage 1: Add Four Text Annotations\" shows the
lines added to the file by this update. The page object is updated
because an **Annots** entry has been added to it. Note that the file's
trailer now contains a **Prev** entry, which points to the original
cross-reference section in the file, while the **startxref** value at
the end of the trailer points to the cross-reference section added by
the update.

### H.7.2 Stage 2: Modify Text of One Annotation

One text annotation is modified and the file is saved. The example in
H.7.2, \"Stage 2: Modify Text of One Annotation\" shows the lines added
to the file by this update. Note that the file now contains two copies
of the object with identifier 10 0 (the text annotation that was
modified) and that the added cross-reference section points to the more
recent version of the object. This added cross-reference section
contains one subsection, which contains only an entry for the object
that was modified. In addition, the **Prev** entry in the file's trailer
has been updated to point to the cross-reference section added in the
previous stage, while the **startxref** value at the end of the trailer
points to the newly added cross-reference section.

>

>

>
> \>\>
>
> startxref 1855
>
> %%EOF

###  H.7.3 Stage 3: Delete Two Annotations

Two text annotation are deleted and the file is saved. Table H.5 lists
the objects updated.

> **Table H.5 -- Object usage after deleting two text annotations**

  -----------------------------------------------
  **Object       **Object type**
  identifier**   
  -------------- --------------------------------
  7 0            Annotation array

  8 0            Free

  9 0            Free
  -----------------------------------------------

The **Annots** array is the only object that is written in this update.
It is updated because it now contains two annotations fewer.

The example in H.7.3, \"Stage 3: Delete Two Annotations\" shows the
lines added when the file was saved. Note that objects with identifiers
8 0 and 9 0 have been deleted, as can be seen from the fact that their
entries in the cross-reference section end with the keyword **f**.

EXAMPLE 7 0 obj

> \[ 10 0 R
>
> 11 0 R
>
> \]
>
> endobj
>
> xref 0 1
>
> 0000000008 65535 f
>
> 7 3
>
> 0000001978 00000 n
>
> 0000000009 00001 f
>
> 0000000000 00001 f
>

>

>
> /Root 1 0 R
>
> /Prev 1855
>
> \>\>
>
> startxref 2027
>
> %%EOF

The cross-reference section added at this stage contains four entries,
representing object number 0, the **Annots** array, and the two deleted
text annotations.

- The cross-reference entry for object number 0 is updated because it is
  the head of the linked list of free entries and points to the entry
  for the newly freed object number 8. The entry for object number 8
  points to the entry for object number 9 (the next free entry), while
  the entry for object number 9 is the last free entry in the
  cross-reference table, indicated by the fact that it points back to
  object number 0.

- The entries for the two deleted text annotations are marked as free
  and as having generation numbers of 1, which are used for any objects
  that reuse these cross-reference entries. Keep in mind that, although
  the two objects have been deleted, they are still present in the file.
  It is the cross-reference table that records the fact that they have
  been deleted.

The **Prev** entry in the trailer has again been updated so that it
points to the cross-reference section added at the previous stage, and
the **startxref** value points to the newly added cross-reference
section.

### H.7.4 Stage 4: Add Three Annotations

Finally, three new text annotations are added to the file. Table H.6
lists the objects involved in this update.

> **Table H.6 -- Object usage after adding three text annotations**

  -----------------------------------------------
  **Object       **Object type**
  identifier**   
  -------------- --------------------------------
  7 0            Annotation array

  8 1            **Annot** (annotation
                 dictionary)

  9 1            **Annot** (annotation
                 dictionary)

  12 0           **Annot** (annotation
                 dictionary)
  -----------------------------------------------

Object numbers 8 and 9, which were used for the two annotations deleted
in the previous stage, have been reused; however, the new objects have
been given a generation number of 1. In addition, the third text
annotation added has been assigned the previously unused object
identifier of 12 0.

The example in H.7.4, \"Stage 4: Add Three Annotations\" shows the lines
added to the file by this update. The added cross-reference section
contains five entries, corresponding to object number 0, the **Annots**
array, and the three annotations added. The entry for object number 0 is
updated because the previously free entries for object numbers 8 and 9
have been reused. The entry for object number 0 now shows that the
cross-reference table has no free entries. The **Annots** array is
updated to reflect the addition of the three text annotations.

The annotation with object identifier 12 0 illustrates splitting a long
text string across multiple lines, as well as the technique for
including nonstandard characters in a string. In this case, the
character is an ellipsis (...), which is character code 203 (octal) in
**PDFDocEncoding**, the encoding used for text annotations.

As in previous updates, the trailer's **Prev** entry and **startxref**
value have been updated.

## H.8 Structured Elements That Describe Hierarchical Lists

H.8, \"Structured Elements That Describe Hierarchical Lists\" presents
examples that illustrate how structured elements are used to describe
hierarchical lists, such as a table of contents or an index.

### H.8.1 Table of Contents

The structured element's structure type entry (**S**) may have values
that establish hierarchical relationships between entries in a table of
content. The TOCI value specifies an individual member of a table of
contents. The TOC value specifies a list made up of other table of
contents items that are individual members of the table of contents
and/or lists of table of contents items. (The trailing character in
***TOCI*** is an upper case "I".) Figure H.5 shows the table of contents
described by the example in H.8.1, \"Table of Contents\".

Figure H.6 illustrates the association between marked content
identifiers (**MCID**) and content. This illustration includes part of
the stream object so you can see how the MCID entries are associated
with the content in the table of contents.

### H.8.2 Nested Lists

The structured element's structure type entry (**S**) may have values
that establish hierarchical relationships between entries in an index.
The LI value specifies an individual index entry. The L value specifies
a list made up of individual index entries and/or lists of index
entries. (The trailing character in ***LI*** is an upper case "I".)
Figure H.8 shows the index described by the example in H.8.2, \"Nested
Lists\".

> **Figure H.8 -- Index**

Figure H.9 shows how the relationships of the structure elements and
their use of the L and LI structure types defines the structure of an
index. This figure also shows the relationship between the structured
content elements and the marked content in the stream. Gray text
indicates marked content identifiers (**MCID**).

**Annex I**

> (normative)

**PDF Versions and Compatibility**

###  I.1 General

The goal of PDF is to enable people to exchange and view electronic
documents easily and reliably. Ideally, this means that any conforming
reader should be able to display the contents of any PDF file, even if
the PDF file was created long before or long after the conforming reader
was developed. In reality, new versions of PDF are occasionally
introduced to provide additional capabilities not present before.
Furthermore, conforming readers may support private extensions to PDF,
making some conforming readers more capable than others, depending on
what extensions are present.

PDF has been designed to enable users to view everything in the document
that the conforming reader understands and to enable the conforming
reader to ignore or inform the user about objects not understood. The
decision whether to ignore or inform the user is made on a
feature-by-feature basis, at the discretion of the confirming reader.

###  I.2 PDF Version Numbers

The PDF version number identifies a specific version of the Adobe PDF
specification. A PDF file is labelled with the version number of the
Adobe PDF specification that the file conforms to.

PDF version numbers take the form *M* . *m*, where *M* is the major and
*m* the minor version number, each represented as a decimal integer.

The version number for a subsequent version of the PDF specification is
formed either by incrementing *m* or by incrementing *M* and setting *m*
to zero, as follows:

- The major version is incremented if PDF changes in a way that is not
  upward-compatible from previous versions. (In practice, this has never
  happened; the current major version is 1.)

- The minor version is incremented if PDF changes in a way that is
  upward-compatible from previous versions. (The current minor version
  is 7.)

- The PDF version number does not change at all if private data is
  included in a PDF file by one of the extension mechanisms defined in
  this specification.

The header in the first line of a PDF file specifies a PDF version (see
7.5.2, \"File Header\"). Starting with PDF 1.4, a PDF version can also
be specified in the **Version** entry of the document catalogue,
essentially updating the version associated with the file by overriding
the one specified in the file header (see 7.7.2, \"Document Catalog\").
As described in the following paragraphs, the conforming product's
behaviour upon opening or saving a document depends on comparing the PDF
file\'s version with the PDF version that the conforming product
supports.

A conforming readers shall attempt to read any PDF file, even if the
file's version is more recent than that of the conforming reader.

If a conforming reader opens a PDF file with a major version number
newer than the version that it supports, it should warn the user that it
is unlikely to be able to read the document successfully and that the
user cannot change or save the document. Upon the first error that is
caused by encountering an unrecognized feature, the conforming reader
should notify the user that an error has occurred but that no further
errors will be reported. (Some errors should nevertheless be always
reported, including file I/O errors, out-of-memory errors, and
notifications that a command has failed.) Processing should continue if
possible.

If a conforming reader opens a PDF file that has a minor version number
newer than the version that it supports, it should notify the user that
the document may contain information the conforming reader does not
understand. If the conforming reader encounters an error, it should
notify the user that the PDF file's version is newer than expected, an
error has occurred, and no further errors will be reported.

Whether and how the version of a PDF file should change when the
document is modified and saved depends on several factors. If the PDF
file has a newer version than the conforming product supports, the
conforming product should not alter the version---that is, a PDF file's
version should never be changed to an older version. If the PDF file has
an older version than the conforming product supports, the conforming
product may update the PDF file's version to match the conforming
product's version. If a user modifies a document by inserting the
contents of another PDF file into it, the saved document's version
should be the most recent of the conforming product's version, the
original PDF file\'s version, and the inserted PDF file's version.

### I.3 Feature Compatibility

When a new version of PDF is defined, many features are introduced
simply by adding new entries to existing dictionaries. Earlier versions
of conforming readers do not notice the existence of such entries and
behave as if they were not there. Such new features are therefore both
forward- and backward-compatible. Likewise, adding entries not described
in the PDF specification to dictionary objects does not affect the
conforming reader's behaviour. See Annex E for information on how to
choose key names that are compatible with future versions of PDF. See
7.12.2, "Developer Extensions Dictionary" for a discussion of how to
designate the use of public extensions in PDF file.

In some cases, a new feature is impossible to ignore, because doing so
would preclude some vital operation such as viewing or printing a page.
For instance, if a page's content stream is encoded with some new type
of filter, there is no way for an earlier version of conforming reader
to view or print the page, even though the content stream (if decoded)
would be perfectly understood by the reader. There is little choice but
to give an error in cases like these. Such new features are
forward-compatible but not backward-compatible.

In a few cases, new features are defined in a way that earlier versions
of conforming readers will ignore, but the output will be degraded in
some way without any error indication. If a PDF file undergoes editing
by an earlier version of a conforming product that does not understand
some of the features that the file uses, the occurrences of those
features may or may not survive.

**FDF Rename Flag Implementation Example**

##  J.1 General

The **Rename** flag is used to specify whether fields imported from the
template shall be renamed in the event of name conflicts with existing
fields;

##  J.2 Implementation Example

If the **Rename** flag in the FDF template dictionary is **true**,
fields with such conflicting names shall be renamed to guarantee their
uniqueness. If **Rename** is **false**, the fields shall not be renamed;
this results in multiple fields with the same name in the target
document. Each time the FDF file provides attributes for a given field
name, all fields with that name shall be updated.

This can be implemented by a conforming product renaming fields by
prepending a page number, a template name, and an ordinal number to the
field name. The ordinal number corresponds to the order in which the
template is applied to a page, with 0 being the first template specified
for the page.

EXAMPLE If the first template used on the fifth page has the name
Template and has the **Rename** flag set to **true**, fields defined in
that template are renamed by prepending the character string P5 .
Template_0 . to their field names.

**PostScript Compatibility --- Transparent Imaging Model**

## K.1 General

Because the PostScript language does not support the transparent imaging
model, a conforming reader desiring to print on a PostScript output
device needs to have some means for converting the appearance of a
document that uses transparency to a purely opaque description.

## K.2 Conversion

Converting the contents of a page from transparent to opaque form
entails some combination of shape decomposition and prerendering to
flatten the stack of transparent objects on the page, performing all the
needed transparency computations, and describing the final appearance
using opaque objects only. Whether the page contains transparent content
needing to be flattened can be determined by straightforward analysis of
the page's resources; it is not necessary to analyse the content stream
itself. The conversion to opaque form is irreversible, since all
information about how the transparency effects were produced is lost.

To perform the transparency computations properly, the conforming reader
needs to know the native colour space of the output device. This is no
problem when the conforming reader controls the output device directly.
However, when generating PostScript output, the conforming reader has no
way of knowing the native colour space of the PostScript output device.
An incorrect assumption will ruin the calibration of any CIE-based
colours appearing on the page. This problem can be addressed in either
of two ways:

- If the entire page consists of CIE-based colours, flatten the colours
  to a single CIE-based colour space rather than to a device colour
  space. The preferred colour space for this purpose can easily be
  determined if the page has a group attributes dictionary (**Group**
  entry in the page object) specifying a CIE-based colour space (see
  11.6.6, \"Transparency Group XObjects\").

- Otherwise, flatten the colours to some assumed device colour space
  with predetermined calibration. In the generated PostScript output,
  paint the flattened colours in a CIE-based colour space having that
  calibration.

Because the choice between using spot colorants and converting them to
an alternate colour space affects the flattened results of process
colours, a decision needs to be made during PostScript conversion about
the set of available spot colorants to assume. (This differs from
strictly opaque painting, where the decision can be deferred until the
generated PostScript code is executed.)
